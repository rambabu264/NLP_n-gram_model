the semantic analysis phase ", "The semantic analysis phase is generally more complex and written by hand but can be partially or fully automated using attribute grammars ", "These phases themselves can be further broken down lexing as scanning and evaluating and parsing as building a concrete syntax tree CST parse tree and then transforming it into an abstract syntax tree AST syntax tree ", "In

performs optimizations on the intermediate representation in order to improve the performance and the quality of the produced machine code ", " The middle end contains those optimizations that are independent of the CPU architecture being targeted ", "The main phases of the middle end include the following Compiler analysis is the prerequisite for any compiler optimization and they tightly work together ", "For example dependence analysis is crucial for loop transformation ", "The scope of compiler analysis and optimizations vary greatly their scope may range from operating within a basic block to whole procedures or even the whole program ", "There is a trade off between the granularity of the optimizations and the cost of compilation ", "For example peephole optimizations are fast to perform during compilation but only affect a small local fragment of the code and can be performed independently of the context in which the code fragment appears ", "In contrast interprocedural optimization requires more compilation time and memory space but enable optimizations that are only possible by considering the behavior of multiple functions simultaneously ", "Interprocedural analysis and optimizations are common in modern commercial compilers from HP IBM SGI Intel Microsoft and Sun Microsystems ", "The free software GCC was criticized for a long time for lacking powerful interprocedural optimizations but it is changing in this respect ", "Another open source compiler with full analysis and optimization infrastructure is Open which is used by many organizations for research and commercial purposes ", "Due to the extra time and space needed for compiler analysis and optimizations some compilers skip them by default ", "Users have to use compilation options to explicitly tell the compiler which optimizations should be enabled ", "The back end is responsible for the CPU architecture specific optimizations and for code generation ", "The main phases of the back end include the following Compiler correctness is the branch of software engineering that deals with trying to show that a compiler behaves according to its language specification ", " citation needed Techniques include developing the compiler using formal methods and using rigorous testing often called compiler validation on an existing compiler ", "Higher level programming languages usually appear with a type of translation in mind either designed as compiled language or interpreted language ", "However in practice there is rarely anything about a language that requires it to be exclusively compiled or exclusively interpreted although it is possible to design languages that rely on re interpretation at run time ", "The categorization usually reflects the most popular or widespread implementations of a language for instance BASIC is sometimes called an interpreted language and C a compiled one despite the existence of BASIC compilers and C interpreters ", "Interpretation does not replace compilation completely ", "It only hides it from the user and makes it gradual ", "Even though an interpreter can itself be interpreted a set of directly executed machine instructions is needed somewhere at the bottom of the execution stack see machine language ", "Furthermore for optimization compilers can contain interpreter functionality and interpreters may include ahead of time compilation techniques ", "For example where an expression can be executed during compilation and the results inserted into the output program then it prevents it having to be recalculated each time the program runs which can greatly speed up the final program ", "Modern trends toward just in time compilation and bytecode interpretation at times blur the traditional categorizations of compilers and interpreters even further ", "Some language specifications spell out that implementations must include a compilation facility for example Common Lisp ", "However there is nothing inherent in the definition of Common Lisp that stops it from being interpreted ", "Other languages have features that are very easy to implement in an interpreter but make writing a compiler much harder for example APL SNOBOL and many scripting languages allow programs to construct arbitrary source code at runtime with regular string operations and then execute that code by passing it to a special evaluation function ", "To implement these features in a compiled language programs must usually be shipped with a runtime library that includes a version of the compiler itself ", "One classification of compilers is by the platform on which their generated code executes ", "This is known as the target platform ", "A native or hosted compiler is one whose output is intended to directly run on the same type of computer and operating system that the compiler itself runs on ", "The output of a cross compiler is designed to run on a different platform ", "Cross compilers are often used when developing software for embedded systems that are not intended to support a software development environment ", "The output of a compiler that produces code for a virtual machine VM may or may not be executed on the same platform as the compiler that produced it ", "For this reason such compilers are not usually classified as native or cross compilers ", "The lower level language that is the target of a compiler may itself be a high level programming language ", "C viewed by some as a sort of portable assembly language is frequently the target language of such compilers ", "For example Cfront the original compiler for C used C as its target language ", "The C code generated by such a compiler is usually not intended to be readable and maintained by humans so indent style and creating pretty C intermediate code are ignored ", "Some of the features of C that make it a good target language include the line directive which can be generated by the compiler to support debugging of the original source and the wide platform support available with C compilers ", "While a common compiler type outputs machine code there are many other types "]},

fridge in October with plans for distribution in December in North America and European markets ", " At launch critics praised the new console hardware and commented positively on its improved graphics reduction of loading times and strong backward compatibility support but due to the lack of any console exclusives remained hesitant of the console s true power ", "Because of this at launch many did not feel these consoles truly represented the next generation of home consoles ", "The lack of significant launch day exclusive titles designed to show off the new hardware capabilities as well as the familiar controller shape and user interface was considered by some to be disappointing given the next generation focus of Sony s PlayStation ", "The Series X was generally considered the better unit when compared to the Series S as the computation and space limitations of the latter made it a less user friendly experience to navigate but still otherwise functional ", " Eurogamer s Richard Leadbetter stated I love the hardware in terms of what I can potentially experience with it and the expert implementation of many of its forward looking features but a console is defined by its games and in that sense I still feel that I barely know the machine at all ", " Keza MacDonald of The Guardian said that while there is no immediate driving force to buy the consoles at launch there s not much to criticise they do everything they promised to do and they do it well ", " Gamasutra s Kris Graft and Chris Kerr said that Microsoft has delivered two highly appealing entry points that can turn players into long term customers while at the same time erasing the idea of generations exposing people to more games past present and future ", " In November Jordan Ram e of GameSpot acknowledged that Xbox Series X and S had begun to see higher profile console exclusive releases since their launch such as Forza Horizon Psychonauts and the third party titles The Artful Escape and The Big Con and that Smart Delivery was a crucial feature of the consoles praising the system for being seamless and automatic unlike PlayStation whose user interface did not make it abundantly clear which version of a game you were choosing to download and play occasionally resulting in players accidentally putting the PS version of a game on their PS ", "He also felt that migrating from an older Xbox One was easier than migrating from PS to PS citing Smart Delivery automatic synchronization of save data and maintaining the same user interface ", " Microsoft announced that the Xbox Series X S

Spain in ", " The present global chip shortage caused the supply of Xbox consoles to fall short of demand ", " Upon launch with high demand outstripping supply for both models the consoles almost immediately sold out across all retailers and in all markets ", " Spencer stated that they had gotten a later start on manufacturing the console in mid as they were waiting for key AMD chip technology to be in place which reduced the availability of supply at launch and though they had reached full production capacity by launch they were still rushing to meet sales demand as well as having made projections on proportions of Series X versus Series S sales ", " Xbox chief financial officer Tim Stuart has stated that shortages were likely to persist through the first quarter of but their supply chain was expected to be up to full capacity by the second quarter of the calendar year ", " The shortage of supply at launch led to scalping on Internet marketplace sites with consoles going for as high as US ", " Starting in May Microsoft offered those in the Xbox Insiders program the ability to sign up for its Console Purchase Pilot program to be placed on a priority list to purchase an Xbox

dynamic super resolution DLDSR a related and opposite technology where the graphics are rendered at a higher resolution then downsampled to the native display resolution using an AI assisted downsampling algorithm to achieve higher image quality than rendering at native resolution ", " Nvidia advertised DLSS as a key feature of the GeForce RTX series cards when they launched in September ", " At that time the results were limited to a few video games namely Battlefield V and Metro Exodus because the algorithm had to be trained specifically on each game on which it was applied and the results were usually not as good as simple resolution upscaling ", " In the video game Control shipped with ray tracing and an improved version of DLSS which did not use the Tensor Cores ", " In April Nvidia advertised and shipped an improved version of DLSS named DLSS with driver version ", "DLSS was available for a few existing games including Control and Wolfenstein Youngblood and would later be added to many newly released games and game engines such as Unreal Engine and Unity ", " This time Nvidia said that it used the Tensor Cores again and that the AI did not need to be trained specifically on each game ", " Despite sharing the DLSS branding the two iterations of DLSS differ significantly and are not backwards compatible ", " The first iteration of DLSS is a predominantly spatial image upscaler with two stages both relying on convolutional auto encoder neural networks ", " The first step is an image enhancement network which uses the current frame and motion vectors to perform edge enhancement and spatial anti aliasing ", "The second stage is an image upscaling step which uses the single raw low resolution frame to upscale the image to the desired output resolution ", "Using just a single frame for upscaling means the neural network itself must generate a large amount of new information to produce the high resolution output this can result in slight hallucinations such as leaves that differ in style to the source content ", " The neural networks are trained on a per game basis by generating a perfect frame using traditional supersampling to samples per pixel as well as the motion vectors for each frame ", "The data collected must be as comprehensive as possible including as many levels times of day graphical settings resolutions etc ", "as possible ", "This data is also augmented using common augmentations such as rotations colour changes and random noise to help generalize the test data ", "Training is performed on Nvidia s Saturn V supercomputer ", " This first iteration received a mixed response with many criticizing the often soft appearance and artifacting in certain situations likely a side effect of the limited data from only using a single frame input to the neural networks which could not be trained to perform optimally in all scenarios and edge cases ", " Nvidia also demonstrated the ability for the auto encoder networks to learn the ability to recreate depth of field and motion blur although this functionality has never been included in a publicly released product ", " citation needed DLSS is a temporal anti aliasing upsampling TAAU implementation using data from previous frames extensively through sub pixel jittering to resolve fine detail and reduce aliasing ", "The data DLSS collects includes the raw low resolution input motion vectors depth buffers and exposure brightness information ", " It can also be used as a simpler TAA implementation where the image is rendered at resolution rather than being upsampled by DLSS Nvidia brands this as DLAA Deep Learning Anti Aliasing ", " TAA U is used in many modern video games and game engines however all previous implementations have used some form of manually written heuristics to prevent temporal artifacts such as ghosting and flickering ", "One example of this is neighborhood clamping which forcefully prevents samples collected in previous frames from deviating too much compared to nearby pixels in newer frames ", "This helps to identify and fix many temporal artifacts but deliberately removing fine details in this way is analogous to applying a blur filter and thus the final image can appear blurry when using this method ", " DLSS uses a convolutional auto encoder neural network trained to identify and fix temporal artifacts instead of manually programmed heuristics as mentioned above ", "Because of this DLSS can generally resolve detail better than other TAA and TAAU implementations while also removing most temporal artifacts ", "This is why DLSS can sometimes produce a sharper image than rendering at higher or even native resolutions using traditional TAA ", "However no temporal solution is perfect and artifacts ghosting in particular are still visible in some scenarios when using DLSS ", "Because temporal artifacts occur in most art styles and environments in broadly the same way the neural network that powers DLSS does not need to be retrained when being used in different games ", "Despite this Nvidia does frequently ship new minor revisions of DLSS with new titles so this could suggest some minor training optimizations may be performed as games are released although Nvidia does not provide changelogs for these minor revisions to confirm this ", "The main advancements compared to DLSS include Significantly improved detail retention a generalized neural network that does not need to be re trained per game and x less overhead ms vs ms ", " It should also be noted that forms of TAAU such as DLSS are not upscalers in the same sense as techniques such as ESRGAN or DLSS which attempt to create new information from a low resolution source instead TAAU works to recover data from previous frames rather than creating new data ", "In practice this means low resolution textures in games will still appear low resolution when using current TAAU techniques ", "This is why Nvidia recommends game developers use higher resolution textures than they would normally for a given rendering resolution by applying a mip map bias when DLSS is enabled ", " Augments DLSS by making use of an optical flow frame generation technique ", "The DLSS frame generation algorithm takes two rendered frames from the rendering pipeline and generates a new frame that smoothly transitions between them ", "So for every frame rendered one additional frame is generated ", " DLSS makes use of a new generation Optical Flow Accelerator OFA included in Ada Lovelace generation RTX GPUs ", "The new OFA is faster and more accurate than the OFA already available in previous Turing and Ampere RTX GPUs ", " This results in DLSS being exclusive for the RTX Series ", "At release DLSS does not work for VR displays

cores ", " Nvidia offers deep learning anti aliasing DLAA ", "DLAA provides the same AI driven anti aliasing DLSS uses but without any upscaling or downscaling functionality ", "With the exception of

conditional instruction will take the CPU can minimize the number of times that the entire pipeline must wait until a conditional instruction is completed ", "Speculative execution often provides modest performance increases by executing portions of code that may not be needed after a conditional operation completes ", "Out of order execution somewhat rearranges the order in which instructions are executed to reduce delays due to data dependencies ", "Also in case of single instruction stream multiple data stream a case when a lot of data from the same type has to be processed modern processors can disable parts of the pipeline so that when a single instruction is executed many times the CPU skips the fetch and decode phases and thus greatly increases performance on certain occasions especially in highly monotonous program engines such as video creation software and photo processing ", "When just a fraction of the CPU is superscalar the part that is not suffers a performance penalty due to scheduling stalls ", "The Intel P Pentium had two superscalar ALUs which could accept one instruction per clock cycle each but its FPU could not ", "Thus the P was integer superscalar but not floating point superscalar ", "Intel s successor to the P architecture P added superscalar abilities to its floating point features ", "Simple pipelining and superscalar design increase a CPU s ILP by allowing it to execute instructions at rates surpassing one instruction per clock cycle ", "Most modern CPU designs are at least somewhat superscalar and nearly all general purpose CPUs designed in the last decade are superscalar ", "In later years some of the emphasis in designing high ILP computers has been moved out of the CPU s hardware and into its software interface or instruction set architecture ISA ", "The strategy of the very long instruction word VLIW causes some ILP to become implied directly by the software reducing the CPU s work in boosting ILP and thereby reducing design complexity ", "Another strategy of achieving performance is to execute multiple threads or processes in parallel ", "This area of research is known as parallel computing ", " In Flynn s taxonomy this strategy is known as multiple instruction stream multiple data stream MIMD ", " One technology used for this purpose was multiprocessing MP ", " The initial flavor of this technology is known as symmetric multiprocessing SMP where a small number of CPUs share a coherent view of their memory system ", "In this scheme each CPU has additional hardware to maintain a constantly up to date view of memory ", "By avoiding stale views of memory the CPUs can cooperate on the same program and programs can migrate from one CPU to another ", "To increase the number of cooperating CPUs beyond a handful schemes such as non uniform memory access NUMA and directory based coherence protocols were introduced in the s ", "SMP systems are limited to a small number of CPUs while NUMA systems have been built with thousands of processors ", "Initially multiprocessing was built using multiple discrete CPUs and boards to implement the interconnect between the processors ", "When the processors and their interconnect are all implemented on a single chip the technology is known as chip level multiprocessing CMP and the single chip as a multi core processor ", "It was later recognized that finer grain parallelism existed with a single program ", "A single program might have several threads or functions that could be executed separately or in parallel ", "Some of the earliest examples of this technology implemented input output processing such as direct memory access as a separate thread from the computation thread ", "A more general approach to this technology was introduced in the s when systems were designed to run multiple computation threads in parallel ", "This technology is known as multi threading MT ", "This approach is considered more cost effective than multiprocessing as only a small number of components within a CPU is replicated to support MT as opposed to the entire CPU in the case of MP ", "In MT the execution units and the memory system including the caches are shared among multiple threads ", "The downside of MT is that the hardware support for multithreading is more visible to software than that of MP and thus supervisor software like operating systems have to undergo larger changes to support MT ", "One type of MT that was implemented is known as temporal multithreading where one thread is executed until it is stalled waiting for data to return from external memory ", "In this scheme the CPU would then quickly context switch to another thread which is ready to run the switch often done in one CPU clock cycle such as the UltraSPARC T ", "Another type of MT is simultaneous multithreading where instructions from multiple threads are executed in parallel within one CPU clock cycle ", "For several decades from the s to early s the focus in designing high performance general purpose CPUs was largely on achieving high ILP through technologies such as pipelining caches superscalar execution out of order execution etc ", "This trend culminated in large power hungry CPUs such as the Intel Pentium ", "By the early s CPU designers were thwarted from achieving higher performance from ILP techniques due to the growing disparity between CPU operating frequencies and main memory operating frequencies as well as escalating CPU power dissipation owing to more esoteric ILP techniques ", "CPU designers then borrowed ideas from commercial computing markets such as transaction processing where the aggregate performance of multiple programs also known as throughput computing was more important than the performance of a single thread or process ", "This reversal of emphasis is evidenced by the proliferation of dual and more core processor designs and notably Intel s newer designs resembling its less superscalar P architecture ", "Late designs in several processor families exhibit CMP including the x Opteron and Athlon X the SPARC UltraSPARC T IBM POWER and POWER as well as several video game console CPUs like the Xbox s triple core PowerPC design and the PlayStation s core Cell microprocessor ", "A less common but increasingly important paradigm of processors and indeed computing in general deals with data parallelism ", "The processors discussed earlier are all referred to as some type of scalar device ", " j As the name implies vector processors deal with multiple pieces of data in the context of one instruction ", "This contrasts with scalar processors which deal with one piece of data for every instruction ", "Using Flynn s taxonomy these two schemes of dealing with data are generally referred to as single instruction stream multiple data stream SIMD and single instruction stream single data stream SISD respectively ", "The great utility in creating processors that deal with vectors of data lies in optimizing tasks that tend to require the same operation for example a sum or a dot product to be performed on a large set of data ", "Some classic examples of these types of tasks include multimedia applications images video and sound as well as many types of scientific and engineering tasks ", "Whereas a scalar processor must complete the entire process of fetching decoding and executing each instruction and value in a set of data a vector processor can perform a single operation on a comparatively large set of data with one instruction ", "This is only possible when the application tends to require many steps which apply one operation to a large set of data ", "Most early vector processors such as the Cray were associated almost exclusively with scientific research and cryptography applications ", "However as multimedia has largely shifted to digital media the need for some form of SIMD in general purpose processors has become significant ", "Shortly after inclusion of floating point units started to become commonplace in general purpose processors specifications for and implementations of SIMD execution units also began to appear for general purpose processors when ", "Some of these early SIMD specifications like HP s Multimedia Acceleration eXtensions MAX and Intel s MMX were integer only ", "This proved to be a significant impediment for some software developers since many of the applications that benefit from SIMD primarily deal with floating point numbers ", "Progressively developers refined and remade these early designs into some of the common modern SIMD specifications which are usually associated with one instruction set architecture ISA ", "Some notable modern examples include Intel s Streaming SIMD Extensions SSE and the PowerPC related AltiVec also known as VMX ", " k Many modern architectures including embedded ones often include hardware performance counters HPC which enables low level instruction level collection benchmarking debugging or analysis of running software metrics ", " HPC may also be used to discover and analyze unusual or suspicious activity of the software such as return oriented programming ROP or sigreturn oriented programming SROP exploits etc ", " This is usually done by software security teams to assess and find malicious binary programs ", "Many major vendors such as IBM Intel AMD and Arm etc ", "provide software interfaces usually written in C C that can be used to collected data from CPUs registers in order to get metrics ", " Operating system vendors also provide software like perf Linux to record benchmark or trace CPU events running kernels and applications ", "Cloud computing can involve subdividing CPU operation into virtual central processing units vCPUs ", "A host is the virtual equivalent of a physical machine on which a virtual system is operating ", " When there are several physical machines operating in tandem and managed as a whole the grouped computing and memory resources form a cluster ", "In some systems it is possible to dynamically add and remove from a cluster ", "Resources available at a host and cluster level can be partitioned out into resources pools with fine granularity ", "The performance or speed of a processor depends on among many other factors the clock rate generally given in multiples of hertz and the instructions per clock IPC which together are the factors for the instructions per second IPS that the CPU can perform ", " Many reported IPS values have represented peak execution rates on artificial instruction sequences with few branches whereas realistic workloads consist of a mix of instructions and applications some of which take longer to execute than others ", "The performance of the memory hierarchy also greatly affects processor performance an issue barely considered in MIPS calculations ", "Because of these problems various standardized tests often called benchmarks for this purpose such as SPECint have been developed to attempt to measure the real effective performance in commonly used applications ", "Processing performance of computers is increased by using multi core processors which essentially is plugging two or more individual processors called cores in this sense into one integrated circuit ", " Ideally a dual core processor would be nearly twice as powerful as a single core processor ", "In practice the performance gain is far smaller only about due to imperfect software algorithms and implementation ", " Increasing the number of cores in a processor i e ", "dual core quad core etc ", "increases the workload that can be handled ", "This means that the processor can now handle numerous asynchronous events interrupts etc ", "which can take a toll on the CPU when overwhelmed ", "These cores can be thought of as different floors in a processing plant with each floor handling a different task ", "Sometimes these cores will handle the same tasks as cores adjacent to them if a single core is not enough to handle the information ", "Due to specific capabilities of modern CPUs such as simultaneous multithreading and uncore which involve sharing of actual CPU resources while aiming at increased utilization monitoring performance levels and hardware use gradually became a more complex task ", " As a response some CPUs implement additional hardware logic that monitors actual use of various parts of a CPU and provides various counters accessible to software an example is Intel s Performance Counter Monitor technology ", "

"Following the unveiling of Windows Microsoft faced criticism particularly from free software supporters for mandating that devices receiving its optional certification for Windows have secure boot enabled by default using a key provided by Microsoft ", "Concerns were raised that secure boot could prevent or hinder the use of alternate operating systems such as Linux ", "In a post discussing secure boot on the Building Windows blog Microsoft developer Tony Mangefeste indicated that vendors would provide means to customize secure boot stating that At the end of the day the customer is in control of their PC ", "Microsoft s philosophy is to provide customers with the best experience first and allow them to make decisions themselves ", " Microsoft s certification guidelines for Windows ultimately revealed that vendors would be required to provide means for users to re configure or disable secure boot in their device s UEFI firmware ", "It also revealed that ARM devices Windows RT would be required to have secure boot permanently enabled with no way for users to disable it ", "However Tom Warren of The Verge noted that other vendors have implemented similar hardware restrictions on their own ARM based tablet and smartphone products including those running Microsoft s own Windows Phone platform but still argued that Microsoft should keep a consistent approach across ARM and x though not least because of the number of users who d love to run Android alongside Windows on their future tablets ", " No mandate is made regarding the installation of third party certificates that would enable running alternative programs ", " Several notable video game developers criticized Microsoft for making its Windows Store a closed platform subject to its own regulations as it conflicted with their view of the PC as an open platform ", "Markus Notch Persson creator of the indie game Minecraft Gabe Newell co founder of Valve and developer of software distribution platform Steam and Rob Pardo from Activision Blizzard voiced concern about the closed nature of the Windows Store ", " However Tom Warren of The Verge stated that Microsoft s addition of the Store was simply responding to the success of both Apple and Google in pursuing the curated application store approach ", " Reviews of the various editions of Windows were mixed to negative ", "Tom Warren of The Verge said that although Windows s emphasis on touch computing was significant and risked alienating desktop users he felt that Windows tablets make an iPad feel immediately out of date due to the capabilities of the operating system s hybrid model and increased focus on cloud services ", " David Pierce of The Verge described Windows as the first desktop operating system that understands what a computer is supposed to do in and praised Microsoft s no compromise approach and the operating system s emphasis on Internet connectivity and cloud services ", "Pierce also considered the Start Screen to be a brilliant innovation for desktop computers when compared with folder littered desktops on every other OS because it allows users to interact with dynamic information ", " In contrast an ExtremeTech article said it was Microsoft flailing and a review in PC Magazine condemned the Metro style user interface ", " Some of the included apps in Windows were considered to be basic and lacking in functionality but the Xbox apps were praised for their promotion of a multi platform entertainment experience ", "Other improvements and features such as File History Storage Spaces and the updated Task Manager were also regarded as positive changes ", " Peter Bright of Ars Technica wrote that while its user interface changes may overshadow them Windows s improved performance updated file manager new storage functionality expanded security features and updated Task Manager were still positive improvements for the operating system ", "Bright also said that Windows s duality towards tablets and traditional PCs was an extremely ambitious aspect of the platform as well but criticized Microsoft for emulating Apple s model of a closed distribution platform when implementing the Windows Store ", " The interface of Windows has been the subject of negative reaction ", "Bright wrote that its system of hot corners and edge swiping wasn t very obvious due to the lack of instructions provided by the operating system on the functions accessed through the user interface even by the video tutorial added on the RTM release which only instructed users to point at corners of the screen or swipe from its sides ", "Despite this stumbling block Bright said that Windows s interface worked well in some places but began to feel incoherent when switching between the Metro and desktop environments sometimes through inconsistent means ", " Tom Warren of The Verge wrote that the new interface was as stunning as it is surprising contributing to an incredibly personal experience once it is customized by the user but had a steep learning curve and was awkward to use with a keyboard and mouse ", "He noted that while forcing all users to use the new touch oriented interface was a risky move for Microsoft as a whole it was necessary in order to push development of apps for the Windows Store ", " Others such as Adrian Kingsley Hughes from ZDNet considered the interface to be clumsy and impractical due to its inconsistent design going as far as considering it two operating systems unceremoniously bolted together and concluded that Windows wasn t born out of a need or demand it was born out of a desire on Microsoft s part to exert its will on the PC industry and decide to shape it in a direction touch and tablets that allows it to compete against and remain relevant in the face of Apple s iPad ", " In Frank X Shaw a Microsoft corporate vice president said that while many of the negative reviews were extreme it was a good thing that Microsoft was listening to feedback and improving a product ", " The American Customer Satisfaction Index ACSI reported a decline in Microsoft s customer satisfaction the lowest it has been since Windows Vista ", " Microsoft says that million users upgraded to Windows over the weekend after its release which CNET says was well below Microsoft s internal projections and was described inside the company as disappointing ", " On November Microsoft announced that it had sold million licenses of Windows in the first month surpassing the pace of Windows ", " However according to research firm NPD sales of devices running Windows in the United States had declined percent compared to the same time period in ", " As the holiday shopping season wrapped up Windows sales continued to lag even as Apple reported brisk sales ", " The market research firm IDC reported an overall drop in PC sales for the quarter and said the drop may have been partly due to consumer reluctance to embrace the new features of the OS and poor support from OEM for these features ", " This capped the first year of declining PC sales to the Asia Pacific region as consumers bought more mobile devices than Windows PCs ", " Windows surpassed Windows Vista in market share with a usage rate according to numbers posted in July by Net Applications with usage on a steady upward trajectory ", " However intake of Windows still lagged behind that of Windows Vista and Windows at the same point in their release cycles ", "Windows s tablet market share also grew steadily with of tablets running Windows in Q according to Strategy Analytics up from nothing just a year before ", "However this was still well below Android and iOS which posted and market share respectively although both operating systems had been on the market much longer than Windows ", " Strategy Analytics also noted a shortage of top tier apps for Windows tablets despite Microsoft strategy of paying developers to create apps for the operating system in addition to for Windows Phone ", " In March Microsoft also amended its certification requirements to allow tablets to use the resolution as a minimum this change is expected to allow the production of certified Windows tablets in smaller form factors a market which is currently dominated by Android based tablets ", " Despite the reaction of industry experts Microsoft reported that they had sold million licenses in the first six months ", "This matched sales of Windows over a similar period ", " This statistic includes shipments to channel warehouses which now need to be sold in order to make way for new shipments ", " In January Hewlett Packard began a promotion for desktops running Windows saying that it was back by popular demand ", "Outside sources have suggested that this might be because HP or its customers thought the Windows platform would be more appropriate for mobile computing than desktop computing or that they were looking to attract customers forced to switch from XP who wanted a more familiar interface ", " In February Bloomberg reported that Microsoft would be lowering the price of Windows licenses by for devices that retail under US alongside the announcement that an update to the operating system would allow OEMs to produce devices with as little as GB of RAM and GB of storage critics felt that these changes would help Windows compete against Linux based devices in the low end market particularly those running Chrome OS ", "Microsoft had similarly cut the price of Windows XP licenses to compete against the early waves of Linux based netbooks ", " Reports also indicated that Microsoft was planning to offer cheaper Windows licenses to OEMs in exchange for setting Internet Explorer s default search engine to Bing ", "Some media outlets falsely reported that the SKU associated with this plan Windows with Bing was a variant which would be a free or low cost variant of Windows for consumers using older versions of Windows ", " On April Microsoft ultimately announced that it would be removing license fees entirely for devices with screens smaller than inches and officially confirmed the rumored Windows with Bing OEM SKU on May ", " On the information gathered by Net Applications adoption rate in March for Windows was at while the original Windows was at ", " Market share had fallen to by October ", " In May the Government of China banned the internal purchase of Windows based products under government contracts requiring energy efficient devices ", "The Xinhua News Agency claimed that Windows was being banned in protest of Microsoft s support lifecycle policy and the end of support for Windows XP which as of January had a market share of in China as the government obviously cannot ignore the risks of running an OS without guaranteed technical support ", "However Ni Guangnan of the Chinese Academy of Sciences had also previously warned that Windows could allegedly expose users to surveillance by the United States government due to its heavy use of Internet based services ", " In June state broadcaster China Central Television CCTV broadcast a news story further characterizing Windows as a threat to national security ", "The story featured an interview with Ni Guangnan who stated that operating systems could aggregate sensitive user information that could be used to understand the conditions and activities of our national economy and society and alleged that per documents leaked by Edward Snowden the U S government had worked with Microsoft to retrieve encrypted information ", "Yang Min a computer scientist at Fudan University also stated that the security features of Windows are basically to the benefit of Microsoft allowing them control of the users data and that poses a big challenge to the national strategy for information security ", "Microsoft denied the claims in a number of posts on the Chinese social network Sina Weibo which stated that the company had never assisted any government in an attack of another government or clients or provided client data to the U S government never provided any government the authority to directly visit or placed any backdoors in its products and services and that it had never concealed government requests for client data ", " A feature update to Windows known as Windows was officially announced by Microsoft on May ", " Following a presentation devoted to it at Build a public beta version of the upgrade was released on June ", " Windows was released to OEM hardware partners on August and released publicly as a free upgrade through Windows Store on October ", " Volume license customers and subscribers to MSDN Plus and TechNet Plus were initially unable to obtain the RTM version upon its release a spokesperson said the policy was changed to allow Microsoft to work with OEMs to ensure a quality experience at general availability ", " However after criticism Microsoft reversed its decision and released the RTM build on MSDN and TechNet on September ", " Windows addressed a number of criticisms faced by Windows upon its release with additional customization options for the Start screen the restoration of a visible Start button on the desktop the ability to snap up to four apps on a single display and the ability to boot to the desktop instead of the Start screen
