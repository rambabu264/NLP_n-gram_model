combination of the combinatorics problems above and the distance function problems explained below ", "When solving dynamic optimization problems by numerical backward induction the objective function

nature from a finite number of data samples in a high dimensional feature space with each feature having a range of possible values typically an enormous amount of training data is required to ensure that there are several samples with each combination of values ", "In an abstract sense as the number of features or dimensions grows the amount of data we need to generalize accurately grows exponentially ", " A typical rule of thumb is that there should be at least training examples for each dimension in the representation ", " In machine learning and insofar as predictive performance is concerned the curse of dimensionality is used interchangeably with the peaking phenomenon which is also known as Hughes phenomenon ", " This phenomenon states that with a fixed number of training samples the average expected predictive power of a classifier or regressor first increases as the number of dimensions or features used is increased but beyond a certain dimensionality it starts deteriorating instead of improving steadily ", " Nevertheless in the context of a simple classifier linear discriminant analysis in the multivariate Gaussian model under the assumption of a common

already part of the classifier is greater or less than the size of this additional feature set the expected error of the classifier constructed using these additional features will be less or greater than the expected error of the classifier constructed without them ", "In other words both the size of additional features and their relative cumulative discriminatory effect are important in observing a decrease or increase in the average predictive power ", "In data mining the curse of dimensionality refers to a data set with too many features ", "Consider the first table which depicts individuals and genes features with a or denoting whether or not they have a genetic mutation in that gene ", "A data mining application to this data set may be finding the correlation between specific genetic mutations and creating a classification algorithm such as a decision tree to determine whether an individual has cancer or not ", "A common practice of data mining in this domain

many features is the notion that the number of false predictions or classifications tend to increase as the number of features grow in the data set ", "In terms of the classification problem discussed

process of the algorithm ", "There may be mutations that are outliers or ones that dominate the overall distribution of genetic mutations when in fact they do not correlate with cancer ", "These features may be working against one s model making it more difficult to obtain optimal results ", "This problem is up to the data miner to solve and there is no universal solution ", "The first step any data miner should take is to explore the data in an attempt to gain an understanding of how it can be used to solve the problem ", "One must first understand what the data means and what they are trying to discover before they can decide if anything must be removed from the data set ", "Then they can create or use a feature selection or dimensionality reduction algorithm to remove samples or features from the data set if they deem it necessary ", "One example of such methods is the interquartile range method used to remove outliers in a data set by calculating the standard deviation of a feature or occurrence ", "When a measure such as a Euclidean distance is defined using many coordinates there is little difference in the distances between different pairs of samples ", "One way to illustrate the vastness of high dimensional Euclidean space is to compare the proportion of an inscribed hypersphere with radius r displaystyle r and dimension d displaystyle d to that of a hypercube with edges of length r ", " displaystyle r ", "The volume of such a sphere is r d d d d displaystyle frac r d pi d d Gamma d where displaystyle Gamma is the gamma function while the volume of the cube is r d displaystyle r d ", "As the dimension d displaystyle d of the space increases the hypersphere becomes an insignificant volume relative to that of the hypercube ", "This can clearly be seen by comparing the proportions as the dimension d displaystyle d goes to infinity Furthermore the distance between the center and the corners is r d displaystyle r sqrt d which increases without bound for fixed r In this sense when points are uniformly generated in a high dimensional hypercube almost all points are much farther than r displaystyle r units away from the centre ", "In high dimensions the volume of the d dimensional unit hypercube with coordinates of the vertices displaystyle pm is concentrated near a sphere with the radius d displaystyle sqrt d sqrt for large dimension d Indeed for each coordinate x i displaystyle x i the average value of x i displaystyle x i in the cube is The variance of x i displaystyle x i for uniform distribution in the cube isTherefore the squared distance

standard deviation d displaystyle frac sqrt d according to the central limit theorem ", "Thus when uniformly generating points in high dimensions both the middle of the hypercube and the corners are empty and all the volume is concentrated near the surface of a sphere of intermediate radius d displaystyle sqrt d ", "This also helps to understand the chi squared distribution ", "Indeed the non central chi squared distribution associated to a random point in the interval is the same as the distribution of the length squared of a random point in the d cube ", "By the law of large numbers this distribution concentrates itself in a narrow band around d times the standard deviation squared of the original derivation ", "This illuminates the chi squared distribution and also illustrates that most of the volume of the d cube concentrates near the boundary of a sphere of radius d displaystyle sigma sqrt d ", "A further development of this phenomenon is as follows ", "Any fixed distribution

random reference point Q and a list of n random data points P Pn become indiscernible compared to the minimum distance This is often cited as distance functions losing their usefulness for the nearest neighbor criterion in feature comparison algorithms for example in high dimensions ", "However recent research has shown this to only hold in the artificial scenario when the one dimensional distributions R displaystyle mathbb R are independent and identically distributed ", " When attributes are correlated data can become easier and provide higher distance contrast and the signal to noise ratio was found to play an important role thus feature selection should be used ", " More recently it has been suggested that there may be a conceptual flaw in the argument that contrast loss creates a curse in high dimensions ", "Machine learning can be understood as the problem of assigning instances to their respective generative process of origin with class labels acting as symbolic representations of individual generative processes ", "The curse s derivation assumes all instances are independent identical outcomes of a single high dimensional generative process ", "If there is only one generative process there would exist only one naturally occurring class and machine learning would be conceptually ill defined in both high and low dimensions ", "Thus the traditional argument that contrast loss creates a curse may be fundamentally inappropriate ", "In addition it has been shown that when the generative model is modified to accommodate multiple generative processes contrast loss can morph from a curse to a blessing as it ensures that the nearest neighbor of an instance is almost surely its most closely related instance ", "From this perspective contrast loss makes high dimensional distances especially meaningful and not especially non meaningful as is often argued ", " The effect complicates nearest neighbor search in high dimensional space ", "It is not possible to quickly reject candidates by using the difference in one coordinate as a lower bound for a distance based on all the dimensions ", " However it has recently been observed that the mere number of dimensions does not necessarily result in difficulties since relevant additional dimensions can also increase the contrast ", "In addition for the resulting ranking it remains useful to discern close and far neighbors ", "Irrelevant noise dimensions however reduce the contrast in the manner described above ", "In time series analysis where the data are inherently high dimensional distance functions also work reliably as long as the signal to noise ratio is high enough ", " Another effect of high dimensionality on distance functions concerns k nearest neighbor k NN graphs constructed from a data set using a distance function ", "As the dimension increases the indegree distribution of the k NN digraph becomes skewed with a peak on the right because of the emergence of a disproportionate number of hubs that is data points that appear in many more k NN lists of other data points than the average ", "This phenomenon can have a considerable impact on various techniques for classification including the k NN classifier semi supervised learning and clustering and it also affects information retrieval ", " In a survey Zimek et al ", "identified the following problems when searching for anomalies in high dimensional data Many of the analyzed specialized methods tackle one or another of these problems but there remain many open research questions ", "Surprisingly and despite the expected curse of dimensionality difficulties common sense heuristics based on the most straightforward methods can yield results which are almost surely optimal for high dimensional problems ", " The term blessing of dimensionality was introduced in the late s ", " Donoho in his Millennium manifesto clearly explained why the blessing of dimensionality will form a basis of future data mining ", " The effects of the blessing of dimensionality were discovered in many applications and found their foundation in the concentration of measure phenomena ", " One example of the blessing of dimensionality phenomenon is linear separability of a random point from a large finite random set with high probability even if this set is exponentially large the number of elements in this random set can grow exponentially with dimension ", "Moreover this linear functional can be selected in the form of the simplest linear Fisher discriminant ", "This separability theorem was proven for a wide class of probability distributions general uniformly log concave distributions product distributions in a cube and many other families reviewed recently in ", " The blessing of dimensionality and the curse of dimensionality are two sides of the same coin ", " For example the typical property of essentially high dimensional probability distributions in a high dimensional space is the squared distance of random points to a selected point is with high probability close to the average or median squared distance ", "This property significantly simplifies the expected geometry of data and indexing of high dimensional data blessing but at the same time it makes the similarity search in high dimensions difficult and even useless curse ", " Zimek et al ", " noted that while the typical formalizations of the curse of dimensionality affect i i d ", "data having data that is separated in each attribute becomes easier even in high dimensions and argued that the signal

situation is at hand Since AI makes decisions solely on the data it receives as input it is important that this data represents accurate patient demographics ", "In a hospital setting patients do not have full knowledge of how predictive algorithms are created or calibrated ", "Therefore these medical establishments can unfairly code their algorithms to discriminate against minorities and prioritize profits rather than providing optimal care ", " There can also be unintended bias in these algorithms that can exacerbate social and healthcare inequities ", " Since AI s decisions are a direct reflection of its input data the data it receives must have accurate representation of patient demographics ", "White males are overly represented in medical data sets ", " Therefore having minimal patient data on minorities can lead to AI making more accurate predictions for majority populations leading to unintended worse medical outcomes for minority populations ", " Collecting data from minority communities can also lead to medical discrimination ", "For instance HIV is a prevalent virus among minority communities and HIV status can be used to discriminate against patients ", " In addition to biases that may arise from sample selection different clinical systems used to collect data may also impact AI functionality ", "For example radiographic systems and their outcomes e g resolution vary by provider ", "Moreover clinician work practices such as the positioning of the patient for radiography can also greatly influence the data and make comparability difficult ", "

best of both old and new ideas ", "He strengthened the infantry and the artillery ", " He paid the members of the standing army from treasury instead of the Mughal method of paying an army with local feudal levies ", " While Ranjit Singh introduced reforms in terms of training and equipment of his military he failed to reform the old Jagirs Ijra system of Mughal middlemen ", " The Jagirs system of state revenue collection involved certain individuals with political connections or inheritance promising a tribute nazarana to the ruler and thereby gaining administrative control over certain villages with the right to force collect customs excise and land tax at inconsistent and subjective rates from the peasants and merchants they would keep a part of collected revenue and deliver the promised tribute value to the state ", " These Jagirs maintained independent armed militia to extort taxes from the peasants and merchants and the militia prone to violence ", " This system of inconsistent taxation with arbitrary extortion by militia continued the Mughal tradition of ill treatment of peasants and merchants throughout the Sikh Empire and is evidenced by the complaints filed to Ranjit Singh by East India Company officials attempting to trade within different parts of the Sikh Empire ", " According to historical records states Sunit Singh Ranjit Singh s reforms focused on military that would allow new conquests but not towards taxation system to end abuse nor about introducing uniform laws in his state or improving internal trade and empowering the peasants and merchants ", " This failure to reform the Jagirs based taxation system and economy in part led to a succession power struggle and a series of threats internal divisions among Sikhs major assassinations and coups in the Sikh Empire in the years immediately after the death of Ranjit Singh an easy annexation of the remains of the Sikh Empire into British India followed with the colonial officials offering the Jagirs better terms and the right to keep the system intact ", " Ranjit Singh ensured that Panjab manufactured and was self sufficient in all weapons equipment and munitions his army needed ", " His government invested in infrastructure in the s and thereafter established raw materials mines cannon foundries gunpowder and arm factories ", " Some of these operations were owned by the state others operated by private Sikh operatives ", " However Ranjit Singh did not make major investments in other infrastructure such as irrigation canals to improve the productivity of land and roads ", "The prosperity in his Empire in contrast to the Mughal Sikh wars era largely came from the improvement in the security situation reduction in violence reopened trade routes and greater freedom to conduct commerce ", " The mid th century Muslim historians such as Shahamat Ali who experienced the Sikh Empire first hand presented a different view on Ranjit Singh s Empire and governance ", " According to Ali Ranjit Singh s government was despotic and he was a mean monarch in contrast to the Mughals ", " The initial momentum for the Empire building in these accounts is stated to be Ranjit Singh led Khalsa army s insatiable appetite for plunder their desire for fresh cities to pillage and eliminating the Mughal era revenue intercepting intermediaries between the peasant cultivator and the treasury ", " According to Ishtiaq Ahmed Ranjit Singh s rule led to further persecution of Muslims in Kashmir expanding clarification needed the previously selective persecution of Shia Muslims and Hindus by Afghan Sunni Muslim rulers between and before Kashmir became part of his Sikh Empire ", " Bikramjit Hasrat describes Ranjit Singh as a benevolent despot ", " The Muslim accounts of Ranjit Singh s rule were questioned by Sikh historians of the same era ", "For example Ratan Singh Bhangu in wrote that these accounts were not accurate and according to Anne Murphy he remarked when would a Musalman praise the Sikhs ", " In contrast the colonial era British military officer Hugh Pearse in criticised Ranjit Singh s rule as one founded on violence treachery and blood ", " Sohan Seetal disagrees with this account and states that Ranjit Singh had encouraged his army to respond with a tit for tat against the enemy violence for violence blood for blood plunder for plunder ", " Singh made his empire and the Sikhs a strong political force for which he is deeply admired and revered in Sikhism ", "After his death empire failed to establish a lasting structure for Sikh government or stable succession and the Sikh Empire began to decline ", "The British and Sikh Empire fought two Anglo Sikh wars with the second ending the reign of Sikh Empire ", " Sikhism itself did not decline ", " Clive Dewey has argued that the decline of the empire after Singh s death owes much to the jagir based economic and taxation system which he inherited from the Mughals and retained ", "After his death a fight to control the tax spoils emerged leading to a power struggle among the nobles and his family from different wives ", "This struggle ended with a rapid series of palace coups and assassinations of his descendants and eventually the annexation of the Sikh Empire by the British ", " In the s Ranjit Singh suffered from numerous health complications as well as a stroke which some historical records attribute to alcoholism and a failing liver ", " He died in his sleep on June ", " Four of his Hindu wives Mehtab Devi Guddan Sahiba daughter of Raja Sansar Chand Rani Har Devi the daughter of Chaudhri Ram a Saleria rajput Rani Raj Devi daughter of Padma Rajput and Rani Rajno Kanwar daughter of Sand Bhari along with seven Hindu concubines with royal titles

remembered for his conquests and building a well trained self sufficient Khalsa army to protect the empire ", " He amassed considerable wealth including gaining the possession of the Koh i Noor diamond from Shuja Shah Durrani of Afghanistan which he left to Jagannath Temple in Puri Odisha in ", " Perhaps Singh s most lasting legacy was the restoration and expansion of the Harmandir Sahib the most revered Gurudwara of the Sikhs which is now known popularly as the Golden Temple ", " Much of the present decoration at the Harmandir Sahib in the form of gilding and marblework was introduced under the patronage of Singh who also sponsored protective walls and water supply system to strengthen security and operations related to the temple ", " He also directed construction of two of the most sacred Sikh temples being the birthplace and place of assassination of Guru Gobind Singh Takht Sri Patna Sahib and Takht Sri Hazur Sahib respectively whom he much admired ", " citation needed The nine story tower of Gurdwara Baba Atal was constructed during his reign ", " In Ranjit Singh established a crafts colony of Thatheras near Amritsar and encouraged skilled metal crafters from Kashmir

replay the entire journal of file system actions then to edit the log to create an up to date directory structure ", "Because the namenode is the single point for storage and management of metadata it can become a bottleneck for supporting a huge number of files especially a large number of small files ", "HDFS Federation a new addition aims to tackle this problem to a certain extent by allowing multiple namespaces served by separate namenodes ", "Moreover there are some issues in HDFS such as small file issues scalability problems Single Point of Failure SPoF and bottlenecks in huge metadata requests ", "One advantage of using HDFS is data awareness between the job tracker and task tracker ", "The job tracker schedules map or reduce jobs to task trackers with an awareness of the data location ", "For example if node A contains data a b c and node X contains data x y z the job tracker schedules node A to perform map or reduce tasks on a b c and node X would be scheduled to perform map or reduce tasks on x y z ", "This reduces the amount of traffic that goes over the network and prevents unnecessary data transfer ", "When Hadoop is used with other file systems this advantage is not always available ", "This can have a significant impact on job completion times as demonstrated with data intensive jobs ", " HDFS was designed for mostly immutable files and may not be suitable for systems requiring concurrent write operations ", " HDFS can be mounted directly with a Filesystem in Userspace FUSE virtual file system on Linux and some other Unix systems ", "File access can be achieved through the native Java API the Thrift API generates a client in a number of languages e g ", "C Java Python PHP Ruby Erlang Perl Haskell C Cocoa Smalltalk and OCaml the command line interface the HDFS UI web application over HTTP or via rd party network client libraries ", " HDFS is designed for portability across various hardware platforms and for compatibility with a variety of underlying operating systems ", "The HDFS design introduces portability limitations that result in some performance bottlenecks since the Java implementation cannot use features that are exclusive to the platform on which HDFS is running ", " Due to its widespread integration into enterprise level infrastructure monitoring HDFS performance at scale has become an increasingly important issue ", "Monitoring end to end performance requires tracking metrics from datanodes namenodes and the underlying operating system ", " There are currently several monitoring platforms to track HDFS performance including Hortonworks Cloudera and Datadog ", "Hadoop works directly with any distributed file system that can be mounted by the underlying operating system by simply using a file URL however this comes at a price the loss of locality ", "To reduce network traffic Hadoop needs to know which servers are closest to the data information that Hadoop specific file system bridges can provide ", "In May the list of supported file systems bundled with Apache Hadoop were A number of third party file system bridges have also been written none of which are currently in Hadoop distributions ", "However some commercial distributions of Hadoop ship with an alternative file system as the default specifically IBM and MapR ", "Atop the file systems comes the MapReduce Engine which consists of one JobTracker to which client applications submit MapReduce jobs ", "The JobTracker pushes work to available TaskTracker nodes in the cluster striving to keep the work as close to the data as possible ", "With a rack aware file system the JobTracker knows which node contains the data and which other machines are nearby ", "If the work cannot be hosted on the actual node where the data resides priority is given to nodes in the same rack ", "This reduces network traffic on the main backbone network ", "If a TaskTracker fails or times out that part of the job is rescheduled ", "The TaskTracker on each node spawns a separate Java virtual machine JVM process to prevent the TaskTracker itself from failing if the running job crashes its JVM ", "A heartbeat is sent from the TaskTracker to the JobTracker every few minutes to check its status ", "The Job Tracker and TaskTracker status and information is exposed by Jetty and can be viewed from a web browser ", "Known limitations of this approach are By default Hadoop uses FIFO scheduling and optionally scheduling priorities to schedule jobs from a work queue ", " In version the job scheduler was refactored out of the JobTracker while adding the ability to use an alternate scheduler such as the Fair scheduler or the Capacity scheduler described next ", " The fair scheduler was developed by Facebook ", " The goal of the fair scheduler is to provide fast response times for small jobs and Quality of service QoS for production jobs ", "The fair scheduler has three basic concepts ", " By default jobs that are uncategorized go into a default pool ", "Pools have to specify the minimum number of map slots reduce slots as well as a limit on the number of running jobs ", "The capacity scheduler was developed by Yahoo ", "The capacity scheduler supports several features that are similar to those of the fair scheduler ", " There is no preemption once a job is running ", "The biggest difference between Hadoop and Hadoop is the addition of YARN Yet Another Resource Negotiator which replaced the MapReduce engine in the first version of Hadoop ", "YARN strives to allocate resources to various applications effectively ", "It runs two daemons which take care of two different tasks the resource manager which does job tracking and resource allocation to applications the application master which monitors progress of the execution ", "There are important features provided by Hadoop ", "For example while there is one single namenode in Hadoop Hadoop enables having multiple name nodes which solves the single point of failure problem ", "In Hadoop there are containers working in principle of Docker which reduces time spent on application development ", "One of the biggest changes is that Hadoop decreases storage overhead with erasure coding ", "Also Hadoop permits usage of GPU hardware within the cluster which is a very substantial benefit to execute deep learning algorithms on a Hadoop cluster ", " The HDFS is not restricted to MapReduce jobs ", "It can be used for other applications many of which are under development at Apache ", "The list includes the HBase database the Apache

electrophysiological level there are various phenomena which alter the response characteristics of individual synapses called synaptic plasticity and individual neurons intrinsic plasticity ", "These are often divided into short term plasticity and long term plasticity ", "Long term synaptic plasticity is often contended to be the most likely memory substrate ", "Usually the term neuroplasticity refers to changes in the brain that are caused by activity or experience ", "Connections display temporal and spatial characteristics ", "Temporal characteristics refers to the continuously modified activity dependent efficacy of synaptic transmission called spike timing dependent plasticity ", "It has been observed in several studies that the synaptic efficacy of this transmission can undergo short term increase called facilitation or decrease depression according to the activity of the presynaptic neuron ", "The induction of long term changes in synaptic efficacy by long term potentiation LTP or depression LTD depends strongly on the relative timing of the onset of the excitatory postsynaptic potential and the postsynaptic action potential ", "LTP is induced by a series of action potentials which cause a variety of biochemical responses ", "Eventually the reactions cause the expression of new receptors on the cellular membranes of the postsynaptic neurons or increase the

inhalation ", "When the circuit is interrupted by an inhibitory signal the muscles relax causing exhalation ", "This type of circuit may play a part in epileptic seizures ", " In a parallel after discharge circuit a neuron inputs to several chains of neurons ", "Each chain is made up of a different number of neurons but their signals converge onto one output neuron ", "Each synapse in the

consider when selecting an appropriate conceptual modeling technique the framework proposed by Gemino and Wand will be discussed in the following text ", "However before evaluating the effectiveness of a conceptual modeling technique for a particular application an important concept must be understood Comparing conceptual models by way of specifically focusing on their graphical or top level representations is shortsighted ", "Gemino and Wand make a good point when arguing that the emphasis should be placed on a conceptual modeling language when choosing an appropriate technique ", "In general a conceptual model is developed using some form of conceptual modeling technique ", "That technique will utilize a conceptual modeling language that determines the rules for how the model is arrived at ", "Understanding the capabilities of the specific language used is inherent to properly evaluating a conceptual modeling technique as the language reflects the techniques descriptive ability ", "Also the conceptual modeling language will directly influence the depth at which the system is capable of being represented whether it be complex or simple ", " Building on some of their earlier work Gemino and Wand acknowledge some main points to consider when studying the affecting factors the content that the conceptual model must represent the method in which the model will be presented the characteristics of the model s users and the conceptual model languages specific task ", " The conceptual model s content should be considered in order to select a technique that would allow relevant information to be presented ", "The presentation method for selection purposes would focus on the technique s ability to represent the model at the intended level of depth and detail ",

misrepresentation of the system or misunderstanding of key system concepts could lead to problems in that system s realization ", "The conceptual model language task will further allow an appropriate technique to be chosen ", "The difference between creating a system conceptual model to convey system functionality and creating a system conceptual model to interpret that functionality could involve two completely different types of conceptual modeling languages ", "Gemino and Wand go on to expand the affected variable content of their proposed framework by considering the focus of observation

intimate understanding of the system being modeled ", "The criterion for comparison would weigh the ability of the conceptual modeling technique to be efficient or effective ", "A conceptual modeling technique that allows for development of a system model which takes all system variables into account at a high level may make the process of understanding the system functionality more efficient but

{"page 34": ["Pages for logged out editors learn moreJean William Fritz Piaget UK pi e US pi e pj e French pja August September was a Swiss psychologist known for his work on child development ", "Piaget s theory of cognitive development and epistemological view are together called genetic epistemology ", " Piaget placed great importance on the education of children ", "As the Director of the International Bureau of Education he declared in that only education is capable of saving our societies from possible collapse whether violent or gradual ", " His theory of child development is studied in pre service education programs ", "Educators continue to incorporate constructivist based strategies ", "Piaget created the International Center for Genetic Epistemology in Geneva in while on the faculty of the University of Geneva and directed the center until his death in ", " The number of collaborations that its founding made possible and their impact ultimately led to the Center being referred to in the scholarly literature as Piaget s factory ", " According to Ernst von Glasersfeld Piaget was the great pioneer of the constructivist theory of knowing ", " However his ideas did not become widely popularized until the s ", " This then led to the emergence of the study of development as a major sub discipline in psychology ", " By the end of the th century Piaget was second only to B F Skinner as the most cited psychologist of that era ", " Piaget was born in in Neuch tel in the Francophone region of Switzerland ", "He was the oldest son of Arthur Piaget Swiss a professor of medieval literature at the University of Neuch tel and Rebecca Jackson French ", "Rebecca Jackson came from a prominent family of French steel foundry owners of English descent through her Lancashire born great grandfather steelmaker James Jackson ", " Piaget was a precocious child who developed an interest in biology and the natural world ", "His early interest in zoology earned him a reputation among those in the field after he had published several articles on mollusks by the age of ", " When he was his former nanny wrote to his parents to apologize for having once lied to them about fighting off a would be kidnapper from baby Jean s pram ", "There never was a kidnapper ", "Piaget became fascinated that he had somehow formed a memory of this kidnapping incident a memory that endured even after he understood it to be false ", " He developed an interest in epistemology due to his godfather s urgings to study the fields of philosophy and logic ", " He was educated at the University of Neuch tel and studied briefly at the University of Z rich ", "During this time he published two philosophical papers that showed the direction of his thinking at the time but which he later dismissed as adolescent thought ", " His interest in psychoanalysis at the time a burgeoning strain of psychology can also be dated to this period ", "Piaget moved from Switzerland to Paris after his graduation and he taught at the Grange Aux Belles Street School for Boys ", "The school was run by Alfred Binet the developer of the Binet Simon test later revised by Lewis Terman to become the Stanford Binet Intelligence Scales ", "Piaget assisted in the marking of Binet s intelligence tests ", "It was while he was helping to mark some of these tests that Piaget noticed that young children consistently gave wrong answers to certain questions ", " Piaget did not focus so much on the fact of the children s answers being wrong but that young children consistently made types of mistakes that older children and adults managed to avoid ", "This led him to the theory that young children s cognitive processes are inherently different from those of adults ", "Ultimately he was to propose a global theory of cognitive developmental stages in which individuals exhibit certain common patterns of cognition in each period of development ", "In Piaget returned to Switzerland as director of the Rousseau Institute in Geneva ", "At this time the institute was directed by douard Clapar de ", " Piaget was familiar with many of Clapar de s ideas ", "including that of the psychological concept groping which was closely associated with trials and errors observed in human mental patterns ", " In he married Valentine Ch tenay January July the couple had three children whom Piaget studied from infancy ", "From to Piaget worked as a professor of psychology sociology and the philosophy of science atthe University of Neuchatel ", " In Jean Piaget accepted the post of Director of the International Bureau of Education and remained the head of this international organization until ", "Every year he drafted his Director s Speeches for the IBE Council and for the International Conference on Public Education in which he explicitly addressed his educational credo ", "Having taught at the University of Geneva and at the University of Paris in Piaget was invited to serve as chief consultant at two conferences at Cornell University March and the University of California Berkeley March ", "The conferences addressed the relationship of cognitive studies and curriculum development and strived to conceive implications of recent investigations of children s cognitive development for curricula ", " In Piaget was awarded the Balzan Prize for Social and Political Sciences ", "Piaget died on September and as he had requested was buried with his family in an unmarked grave in the Cimeti re des Rois Cemetery of Kings in Geneva ", " Harry Beilin described Jean Piaget s theoretical research program as consisting of four phases The resulting theoretical frameworks are sufficiently different from each other that they have been characterized as representing different Piagets ", "More recently Jeremy Burman responded to Beilin and called for the addition of a phase before his turn to psychology the zeroeth Piaget ", " Before Piaget became a psychologist he trained in natural history and philosophy ", "He received a doctorate in from the University of Neuch tel ", "He then undertook post doctoral training in Z rich and Paris ", "He was hired by Th odore Simon to standardize psychometric measures for use with French children in ", " The theorist we recognize today only emerged when he moved to Geneva to work for douard Clapar de as director of research at the Rousseau Institute in ", "Piaget first developed as a psychologist in the s ", "He investigated the hidden side of children s minds ", "Piaget proposed that children moved from a position of egocentrism to sociocentrism ", "For this explanation he combined the use of psychological and clinical methods to create what he called a semiclinical interview ", "He began the interview by asking children standardized questions and depending on how they answered he would ask them a series of nonstandard questions ", "Piaget was looking for what he called spontaneous conviction so he often asked questions the children neither expected nor anticipated ", "In his studies he noticed there was a gradual progression from intuitive to scientific and socially acceptable responses ", "Piaget theorized children did this because of the social interaction and the challenge to younger children s ideas by the ideas of those children who were more advanced ", "This work was used by Elton Mayo as the basis for the famous Hawthorne Experiments ", " For Piaget it also led to an honorary doctorate from Harvard in ", " In this stage Piaget believed that the process of thinking and intellectual development could be regarded as an extension of the biological process of the adaptation of the species which has also two ongoing processes assimilation and accommodation ", "There is assimilation when a child responds to a new event in a way that is consistent with an existing schema ", " There is accommodation when a child either modifies an existing schema or forms an entirely new schema to deal with a new object or event ", " He argued infants were engaging in the act of assimilation when they sucked on everything in their reach ", "He claimed infants transform all objects into an object to be sucked ", "The children were assimilating the objects to conform to their own mental structures ", "Piaget then made the assumption that whenever one transforms the world to meet individual needs or conceptions one is in a way assimilating it ", "Piaget also observed his children not only assimilating objects to fit their needs but also modifying some of their mental structures to meet the demands of the environment ", "This is the second division of adaptation known as accommodation ", "To start the infants only engaged in primarily reflex actions such as sucking but not long after they would pick up objects and put them in their mouths ", "When they do this they modify their reflex response to accommodate the external objects into reflex actions ", "Because the two are often in conflict they provide the impetus for intellectual development the constant need to balance the two triggers intellectual growth ", "To test his theory Piaget observed the habits in his own children ", "In the model Piaget developed in stage three he argued that intelligence develops in a series of stages that are related to age and are progressive because one stage must be accomplished before the next can occur ", "For each stage of development the child forms a view of reality for that age period ", "At the next stage the child must keep up with earlier level of mental abilities to reconstruct concepts ", "Piaget conceived intellectual development as an upward expanding spiral in which children must constantly reconstruct the ideas formed at earlier levels with new higher order concepts acquired at the next level ", "It is primarily the Third Piaget the logical model of intellectual development that was debated by American psychologists when Piaget s ideas were rediscovered in the s ", " Piaget studied areas of intelligence like perception and memory that are not entirely logical ", "Logical concepts are described as being completely reversible because they can always get back to the starting point meaning that if one starts with a given premise and follows logical steps to reach a conclusion the same steps may be done in the opposite order starting from the conclusion to arrive at the premise ", "The perceptual concepts Piaget studied could not be manipulated ", "To describe the figurative process Piaget uses pictures as examples ", "Pictures cannot be separated because contours cannot be separated from the forms they outline ", "Memory is the same way it is never completely reversible people cannot necessarily recall all the intervening events between two points ", "During this last period of work Piaget and his colleague Inhelder also published books on perception memory and other figurative processes such as learning ", " Because Piaget s theory is based upon biological maturation and stages the notion of readiness is important ", "Readiness concerns when certain information or concepts should be taught ", "According to Piaget s theory children should not be taught certain concepts until they reached the appropriate stage of cognitive development ", " For example young children in the preoperational stage engage in irreversible thought and cannot comprehend that an item that has been transformed in some way may be returned to its original state ", " Piaget defined himself as a genetic epistemologist interested in the process of the qualitative development of knowledge ", "He considered cognitive structures development as a differentiation of biological regulations ", "When his entire theory first became known the theory in itself being based on a structuralist and a cognitivitist approach it was an outstanding and exciting development in regards to the psychological community at that time ", " There are a total of four phases in Piaget s research program that included books on certain topics of developmental psychology ", "In particular during one period of research he described himself studying his own three children and carefully observing and interpreting their cognitive development ", " In one of his last books Equilibration of Cognitive Structures The Central Problem of Intellectual Development he intends to explain knowledge development as a process of equilibration using two main concepts in his theory assimilation and accommodation as belonging not only to biological interactions but also to cognitive ones ", " Piaget believed answers for the epistemological questions at his time could be answered or better proposed if one looked to the genetic aspect of it hence his experimentations with children and adolescents ", "As he says in the introduction of his book Genetic Epistemology What the genetic epistemology proposes is discovering the roots of the different varieties of knowledge since its elementary forms following to the next levels including also the scientific knowledge ", "The four development stages are described in Piaget s theory as ", "Sensorimotor stage from birth to age two ", "The children experience the world through movement and their senses ", "During the sensorimotor stage children are extremely egocentric meaning they cannot perceive the world from others viewpoints ", "The sensorimotor stage is divided into six substages Some followers of Piaget s studies of infancy such as Kenneth Kaye argue that his contribution was as an observer of countless phenomena not previously described but that he didn t offer explanation of the processes in real time that cause those developments beyond analogizing them to broad concepts about biological adaptation generally ", "Kaye s apprenticeship theory of cognitive and social development refuted Piaget s assumption that mind developed endogenously in infants until the capacity for symbolic reasoning allowed them to learn language ", " ", "Preoperational stage Piaget s second stage the preoperational stage starts when the child begins to learn to speak at age two and lasts up until the age of seven ", "During the preoperational stage of cognitive development Piaget noted that children do not yet understand concrete logic and cannot mentally manipulate information ", "Children s increase in playing and pretending takes place in this stage ", "However the child still has trouble seeing things from different points of view ", "The children s play is mainly categorized by symbolic play and manipulating symbols ", "Such play is demonstrated by the idea of checkers being snacks pieces of paper being plates and a box being a table ", "Their observations of symbols exemplifies the idea of play with the absence of the actual objects involved ", "By observing sequences of play Piaget was able to demonstrate that towards the end of the second year a qualitatively new kind of psychological functioning occurs known as the preoperational stage ", " The preoperational stage is sparse and logically inadequate in regard to mental operations ", "The child is able to form stable concepts as well as magical beliefs ", "The child however is still not able to perform operations which are tasks that the child can do mentally rather than physically ", "Thinking in this stage is still egocentric meaning the child has difficulty seeing the viewpoint of others ", "The preoperational stage is split into two substages the symbolic function substage and the intuitive thought substage ", "The symbolic function substage is when children are able to understand represent remember and picture objects in their mind without having the object in front of them ", "The intuitive thought substage is when children tend to propose the questions of why ", "and how come ", "This stage is when children want the knowledge of knowing everything ", " The Preoperational Stage is divided into two substages ", "Concrete operational stage from ages seven to eleven ", "Children can now converse and think logically they understand reversibility but are limited to what they can physically manipulate ", "They are no longer egocentric ", "During this stage children become more aware of logic and conservation topics previously foreign to them ", "Children also improve drastically with their classification skills ", "Formal operational stage from age eleven to sixteen and onwards development of abstract reasoning ", "Children develop abstract thought and can easily conserve and think logically in their mind ", "Abstract thought is newly present during this stage of development ", "Children are now able to think abstractly and use metacognition ", "Along with this the children in the formal operational stage display more skills oriented towards problem solving often in multiple steps ", "Piaget had sometimes been criticized for characterizing preoperational children in terms of the cognitive capacities they lacked rather than their cognitive accomplishments ", "A late turn in the development of Piaget s theory saw the emergence of work on the accomplishments of those children within the framework of his psychology of functions and correspondences ", " This new phase in Piaget s work was less stage dependent and reflected greater continuity in human development than would be expected in a stage bound theory ", " This advance in his work took place toward the end of his very productive life and is sometimes absent from developmental psychology textbooks ", "An example of a function can involve sets X and Y and ordered pairs of elements x y in which x is an element of X and y Y ", "In a function an element of X is mapped onto exactly one element of Y the reverse need not be true ", "A function therefore involves a unique mapping in one direction or as Piaget and his colleagues have written functions are univocal to the right Piaget et al p ", " When each element of X maps onto exactly one element of Y and each element of Y maps onto exactly one element of X Piaget and colleagues indicated that the uniqueness condition holds in either direction and called the relationship between the elements of X and Y biunivocal or one to one ", " They advanced the idea that the preoperational child manifests some understanding of one way order functions ", "According to Piaget s Genevan colleagues the semilogic of these order functions sustains the preoperational child s ability to use of spatial extent to index and compare quantities ", "The child for example could use the length of an array to index the number of objects in the array ", "Thus the child would judge the longer of two arrays as having the greater number of objects ", "Although imperfect such comparisons are often fair semilogical substitutes for exact quantification ", "Furthermore these order functions underlie the child s rudimentary knowledge of environmental regularities ", " Young children are capable of constructing this reflects the constructivist bent of Piaget s work sequences of objects of alternating color ", "They also have an understanding of the pairwise exchanges of cards having pictures of different flowers ", "Piaget and colleagues have examined morphisms which to them differ from the operative transformations observed on concrete operational children ", " Piaget wrote that correspondences and morphisms are essentially comparisons that do not transform objects to be compared but that extract common forms from them or analogies between them p ", " He advanced the idea that this type of knowledge emerges from primitive applications of action schemes to objects in the environment ", " In one study of morphisms Piaget and colleagues asked children to identify items in a series of movable red cutouts that could cover a pre specified section of each of four base cards each card had a red area and a white area ", " The task in effect asked the child to superimpose the cut outs on a base card to make the entire card appear to be red ", "Although there were cutouts in all only three which differed slightly from each other could make an entire base card look red ", "The youngest children studied they were age could match using trial and error one cut out to one base card ", "Piaget et al ", "called this type of morphism bijection a term by term correspondence ", "Older children were able to do more by figuring out how to make entire card appear to be red by using three cutouts ", "In other words they could perform three to one matching ", "Piaget et al ", " called a many to one match surjection ", "Piaget provided no concise description of the development process as a whole ", "Broadly speaking it consisted of a cycle This process may not be wholly gradual but new evidence shows that the passage into new stages is more gradual than once thought ", "Once a new level of organization knowledge and insight proves to be effective it will quickly be generalized to other areas if they exist ", "As a result transitions between stages can seem to be rapid and radical but oftentimes the child has grasped one aspect of the new stage of cognitive functioning but not addressed others ", "The bulk of the time spent in a new stage consists of refining this new cognitive level however it does not always happen quickly ", "For example a child may see that two different colors of Play Doh have been fused together to make one ball based on the color ", "However if sugar is mixed into water or iced tea then the sugar disappeared and therefore does not exist to the child at that stage ", "These levels of one concept of cognitive development are not realized all at once giving us a gradual realization of the world around us ", " It is because this process takes this dialectical form in which each new stage is created through the further differentiation integration and synthesis of new structures out of the old that the sequence of cognitive stages are logically necessary rather than simply empirically correct ", "Each new stage emerges only because the child can take for granted the achievements of its predecessors and yet there are still more sophisticated forms of knowledge and action that are capable of being developed ", "Because it covers both how we gain knowledge about objects and our reflections on our own actions Piaget s model of development explains a number of features of human knowledge that had never previously been accounted for ", "For example by showing how children progressively enrich their understanding of things by acting on and reflecting on the effects of their own previous knowledge they are able to organize their knowledge in increasingly complex structures ", "Thus once a young child can consistently and accurately recognize different kinds of animals he or she then acquires the ability to organize the different kinds into higher groupings such as birds fish and so on ", "This is significant because they are now able to know things about a new animal simply on the basis of the fact that it is a bird for example that it will lay eggs ", "At the same time by reflecting on their own actions children develop an increasingly sophisticated awareness of the rules that govern them in various ways ", "For example it is by this route that Piaget explains this child s growing awareness of notions such as right valid necessary proper and so on ", "In other words it is through the process of objectification reflection and abstraction that the child constructs the principles on which action is not only effective or correct but also justified ", "One of Piaget s most famous studies focused purely on the discriminative abilities of children between the ages of two and a half years old and four and a half years old ", "He began the study by taking children of different ages and placing two lines of sweets one with the sweets in a line spread further apart and one with the same number of sweets in a line placed more closely together ", "He found that Children between years months old and years months old correctly discriminate the relative number of objects in two rows between years months and years months they indicate a longer row with fewer objects to have more after years months they again discriminate correctly Cognitive Capacity of Very Young Children p ", "Initially younger children were not studied because if at four years old a child could not conserve quantity then a younger child presumably could not either ", "The results show however that children that are younger than three years and two months have quantity conservation but as they get older they lose this quality and do not recover it until four and a half years old ", "This attribute may be lost due to a temporary inability to solve because of an overdependence on perceptual strategies which correlates more candy with a longer line of candy or due to the inability for a four year old to reverse situations ", "By the end of this experiment several results were found ", "First younger children have a discriminative ability that shows the logical capacity for cognitive operations exists earlier than acknowledged ", "This study also reveals that young children can be equipped with certain qualities for cognitive operations depending on how logical the structure of the task is ", "Research also shows that children develop explicit understanding at age and as a result the child will count the sweets to decide which has more ", "Finally the study found that overall quantity conservation is not a basic characteristic of humans native inheritance ", "According to Jean Piaget genetic epistemology attempts to explain knowledge and in particular scientific knowledge on the basis of its history its sociogenesis and especially the psychological origins of the notions and operations upon which it is based ", "Piaget believed he could test epistemological questions by studying the development of thought and action in children ", "As a result Piaget created a field known as genetic epistemology with its own methods and problems ", "He defined this field as the study of child development as a means of answering epistemological questions ", "A schema plural form schemata is a structured cluster of concepts it can be used to represent objects scenarios or sequences of events or relations ", "The philosopher Immanuel Kant first proposed the concept of schemata as innate structures used to help us perceive the world ", " A schema is a mental framework that is created as children interact with their physical and social environments ", " For example many year olds insist that the sun is alive because it comes up in the morning and goes down at night ", "According to Piaget these children are operating based on a simple cognitive schema that things that move are alive ", "At any age children rely on their current cognitive structures to understand the world around them ", "Moreover younger and older children may often interpret and respond to the same objects and events in very different ways because cognitive structures take different forms at different ages ", " Piaget described three kinds of intellectual structures behavioural or sensorimotor schemata symbolic schemata and operational schemata ", "According to Piaget children use the process of assimilation and accommodation to create a schema or mental framework for how they perceive and or interpret what they are experiencing ", "As a result the early concepts of young children tend to be more global or general in nature ", " Similarly Gallagher and Reid maintained that adults view children s concepts as highly generalized and even inaccurate ", "With added experience interactions and maturity these concepts become refined and more detailed ", "Overall making sense of the world from a child s perspective is a very complex and time consuming process ", " A schema is These schemata are constantly being revised and elaborated upon each time the child encounters new experiences ", "In doing this children create their own unique understanding of the world interpret their own experiences and knowledge and subsequently use this knowledge to solve more complex problems ", "In a neurological sense the brain mind is constantly working to build and rebuild itself as it takes in adapts modifies new information and enhances understanding ", " Piaget wanted to revolutionize the way research was conducted ", "Although he started researching with his colleagues using a traditional method of data collection he was not fully satisfied with the results and wanted to keep trying to find new ways of researching using a combination of data which included naturalistic observation psychometrics and the psychiatric clinical examination in order to have a less guided form of research that would produce more empirically valid results ", "As Piaget developed new research methods he wrote a book called The Language and Thought of the Child which aimed to synthesize the methods he was using in order to study the conclusion children drew from situations and how they arrived to such conclusion ", "The main idea was to observe how children responded and articulated certain situations with their own reasoning in order to examine their thought processes Mayer ", "Piaget administered a test in boys with ages ranging from to years in which he asked participants to describe the relationship between a mixed bouquet of flowers and a bouquet with flowers of the same color ", "The purpose of this study was to analyze the thinking process the boys had and to draw conclusions about the logic processes they had used which was a psychometric technique of research ", "Piaget also used the psychoanalytic method initially developed by Sigmund Freud ", "The purpose of using such method was to examine the unconscious mind as well as to continue parallel studies using different research methods ", "Psychoanalysis was later rejected by Piaget as he thought it was insufficiently empirical Mayer ", "Piaget argued that children and adults used speech for different purposes ", "In order to confirm his argument he experimented analyzing a child s interpretation of a story ", "In the experiment the child listened to a story and then told a friend that same story in his her their own words ", "The purpose of this study was to examine how children verbalize and understand each other without adult intervention ", "Piaget wanted to examine the limits of naturalistic observation in order to understand a child s reasoning ", "He realized the difficulty of studying children s thoughts as it is hard to know if a child is pretending to believe their thoughts or not ", "Piaget was the pioneer researcher to examine children s conversations in a social context starting from examining their speech and actions where children were comfortable and spontaneous Kose ", "After conducting many studies Piaget was able to find significant differences in the way adults and children reason however he was still unable to find the path of logic reasoning and the unspoken thoughts children had which could allow him to study a child s intellectual development over time Mayer ", "In his third book The Child s Conception of the World Piaget recognized the difficulties of his prior techniques and the importance of psychiatric clinical examination ", "The researcher believed that the way clinical examinations were conducted influenced how a child s inner realities surfaced ", "Children would likely respond according to the way the research is conducted the questions asked or the familiarity they have with the environment ", "The clinical examination conducted for his third book provides a thorough investigation into a child s thinking process ", "An example of a question used to research such process was Can you see a thought ", " Mayer p ", "Piaget recognized that psychometric tests had its limitations as children were not able to provide the researcher with their deepest thoughts and inner intellect ", "It was also difficult to know if the results of child examination reflected what children believed or if it is just a pretend situation ", "For example it is very difficult to know with certainty if a child who has a conversation with a toy believes the toy is alive or if the child is just pretending ", "Soon after drawing conclusions about psychometric studies Piaget started developing the clinical method of examination ", "The clinical method included questioning a child and carefully examining their responses in order to observe how the child reasoned according to the questions asked and then examining the child s perception of the world through their responses ", "Piaget recognized the difficulties of interviewing a child and the importance of recognizing the difference between liberated versus spontaneous responses Mayer p ", "Judged by today s standards of psychological research Piaget s research methods would be considered problematic ", "Indeed one modern reviewer has commented that many of Piaget s pioneering investigations would probably be rejected from most modern journals on methodological grounds of sample size non standard measurement and lack of inter rater reliability ", " Piaget s research relied on very small samples that were not randomly selected ", "His book The Origins of Intelligence in Children was based on the study of just three children his own ", " This means that it is difficult to generalize Piaget s findings to the broader population ", "Piaget interacted closely with his research subjects and did not follow a set script meaning that experimental conditions may not have been exactly the same from participant to participant introducing issues of consistency ", "As he worked in the era before widespread use of voice recording equipment his data collection method was simply to make handwritten notes in the field which he would analyse himself ", " This differs from the modern practice of using multiple coders to ensure test validity ", "Furthermore critics such as Linda Siegel have argued that Piaget s experiments did not adequately control for social context and the child s understanding or lack of understanding of the language used in the test task leading to mistaken conclusions about children s lack of reasoning skills ", " These methodological issues mean that when scientists have tried to replicate Piaget s experiments they have found that small changes to Piaget s procedures lead to different results ", "For example in Piaget s tests of object permanence and conservation of number the ages at which children pass the tests varies greatly based on small variations in the test procedure challenging Piaget s theoretical interpretations of his test results ", " Piaget wanted to research in environments that would allow children to connect with some existing aspects of the world ", "The idea was to change the approach described in his book The Child s Conception of the World and move away from the vague questioning interviews ", "This new approach was described in his book The Child s Conception of Physical Causality where children were presented with dilemmas and had to think of possible solutions on their own ", "Later after carefully analyzing previous methods Piaget developed a combination of naturalistic observation with clinical interviewing in his book Judgment and Reasoning in the Child where a child s intellect was tested with questions and close monitoring ", "Piaget was convinced he had found a way to analyze and access a child s thoughts about the world in a very effective way Mayer ", "Piaget s research provided a combination of theoretical and practical research methods and it has offered a crucial contribution to the field of developmental psychology Beilin ", " Piaget is often criticized because his method of investigation though somewhat modified in recent years is still largely clinical ", "He observes a child s surroundings and behavior ", "He then comes up with a hypothesis testing it and focusing on both the surroundings and behavior after changing a little of the surrounding ", " Despite his ceasing to be a fashionable psychologist the magnitude of Piaget s continuing influence can be measured by the global scale and activity of the Jean Piaget Society which holds annual conferences and attracts around participants ", " His theory of cognitive development has proved influential in many different areas Piaget is considered to be the most influential figure in developmental psychology ", "However many of aspects of his theories are no longer accepted by mainstream psychologists ", "Developmental psychologists today do not view development as taking place in stages and many of Piaget s empirical findings have been overturned by subsequent research ", " For example psychologists no longer view young children as being incapable of understanding abstract concepts and no longer believe that babies do not understand object permanence ", " Despite this developmental psychologists do acknowledge the importance of Jean Piaget s legacy as the founder of their field ", "They recognize his innovative empirical work his attempts to integrate his results into a unified theoretical model and the way he created a path for subsequent researchers to follow ", " Indeed many developmental psychology researchers today work in a post Piagetian or neo Piagetian framework ", " By using Piaget s theory educators focus on their students as learners ", "As a result of this focus education is learner centered and constructivist based to an extent ", "Piaget s theory allows teachers to view students as individual learners who add new concepts to prior knowledge to construct or build understanding for themselves ", " Teachers who use a learner centered approach as a basis for their professional practices incorporate the several dispositions ", " They provide experience based educational opportunities ", "These teachers also contemplate the learners individual qualities and attitudes during curriculum planning ", "Educators allow learners insights to alter the curriculum ", "They nourish and support learners curiosity ", "They also involve learners emotions and create a learning environment in which students feel safe ", " There are two differences between the preoperational and concrete operational stages that apply to education ", "These differences are reversibility and decentration ", "At times reversibility and decentration occur at the same time ", " When students think about the steps to complete a task without using a particular logical sequential order they are using reversibility ", " Decentration allows them to concentrate on multiple components of a problematic task at a time ", " Students use both reversibility and decentration to function throughout the school day follow directions and complete assignments ", "An example of a student using reversibility is when learning new vocabulary ", "The student creates a list of unfamiliar words from a literary text ", "Then he researches the definition of those words before asking classmate to test him ", "His teacher has given a set of particular instructions that he must follow in a particular order he must write the word before defining it and complete these two steps repeatedly ", " A child in the preoperational stage gets confused during this process and needs assistance from the teacher to stay on task ", "The teacher refers him back to his text in order to notate the next word before he can define it ", " A child in the preoperational stage does not understand the organization required to complete this assignment ", "However a child in the concrete operational stage understands the organization and he can recall the steps in any order while being able to follow the order given ", " Using decentration the child has the two activities on his mind identify words and find them in the dictionary ", " A sample of decentration is a preschooler may use a toy banana as a pretend telephone ", "The child knows the difference between the fruit and a phone ", "However in this form of play he is operating on two levels at once ", " In an older child at the concrete operational level decentration allows him to complete subtraction of two digit numbers and indicate which of the problems also involved borrowing from the other column ", "The student simultaneously does both ", " Using reversibility the student has to move mentally between two subtasks ", "Regarding the giving of praise by teachers praise is a reinforcer for students ", "Adolescents undergo social emotional development such that they seek rapport with peers ", "Thus teacher praise is not as powerful for students who see teachers as authority figures ", "They give no value to praise provided by adults or they have no respect for the individual who is giving praise ", " During the s and s Piaget s works also inspired the transformation of European and American education including both theory and practice leading to a more child centered approach ", "In Conversations with Jean Piaget Bringuier says Education for most people means trying to lead the child to resemble the typical adult of his society but for me and no one else education means making creators You have to make inventors innovators not conformists Bringuier p ", "His theory of cognitive development can be used as a tool in the early childhood classroom ", "According to Piaget children developed best in a classroom with interaction ", "Piaget defined knowledge as the ability to modify transform and operate on an object or idea such that it is understood by the operator through the process of transformation ", " Learning then occurs as a result of experience both physical and logical with the objects themselves and how they are acted upon ", "Thus knowledge must be assimilated in an active process by a learner with matured mental capacity so that knowledge can build in complexity by scaffolded understanding ", "Understanding is scaffolded by the learner through the process of equilibration whereby the learner balances new knowledge with previous understanding thereby compensating for transformation of knowledge ", " Learning then can also be supported by instructors in an educational setting ", "Piaget specified that knowledge cannot truly be formed until the learner has matured the mental structures to which that learning is specific and thereby development constrains learning ", "Nevertheless knowledge can also be built by building on simpler operations and structures that have already been formed ", "Basing operations of an advanced structure on those of simpler structures thus scaffolds learning to build on operational abilities as they develop ", "Good teaching then is built around the operational abilities of the students such that they can excel in their operational stage and build on preexisting structures and abilities and thereby build learning ", " Evidence of the effectiveness of a contemporary curricular design building on Piaget s theories of developmental progression and the support of maturing mental structures can be seen in Griffin and Case s Number Worlds curriculum ", " The curriculum works toward building a central conceptual structure of number sense in young children by building on five instructional processes including aligning curriculum to the developmental sequencing of acquisition of specific skills ", "By outlining the developmental sequence of number sense a conceptual structure is built and aligned to individual children as they develop ", "However the cognitive scientist Karen Fuson has argued that the impact of Piagetian theories in education has not been entirely positive because his work has frequently been misinterpreted ", "In particular Piaget s focus on children s interactions with objects in the concrete operational stage has led to an approach to education in which young children are encouraged to learn mathematics by manipulating real objects but without the necessary direct instruction from teachers that they need to understand what they are doing and to link their activities to symbolic mathematics ", "This has had a particularly negative impact on low attaining children who need more support from a more knowledgeable other to make meaning and progress with their learning ", " Psychologist Mark Seidenberg has criticised the field of Education Studies for placing too much emphasis on the works of Jean Piaget Lev Vygotsky and other historical psychologists while failing to keep up with the major advances in cognitive science in the decades since they were active ", " Meanwhile a systematic review of education research showed that constructivist approaches to early childhood education inspired by Piaget and Vygotsky are less effective than comprehensive approaches that incorporate direct skills teaching ", " Piaget believed in two basic principles relating to character education that children develop moral ideas in stages and that children create their conceptions of the world ", "According to Piaget the child is someone who constructs his own moral world view who forms ideas about right and wrong and fair and unfair that are not the direct product of adult teaching and that are often maintained in the face of adult wishes to the contrary Gallagher p ", "Piaget believed that children made moral judgments based on their own observations of the world ", "Piaget s theory of morality was radical when his book The Moral Judgment of the Child was published in for two reasons his use of philosophical criteria to define morality as universalizable generalizable and obligatory and his rejection of equating cultural norms with moral norms ", "Piaget drawing on Kantian theory proposed that morality developed out of peer interaction and that it was autonomous from authority mandates ", "Peers not parents were a key source of moral concepts such as equality reciprocity and justice ", "Piaget attributed different types of psychosocial processes to different forms of social relationships introducing a fundamental distinction between different types of said relationships ", "Where there is constraint because one participant holds more power than the other the relationship is asymmetrical and importantly the knowledge that can be acquired by the dominated participant takes on a fixed and inflexible form ", "Piaget refers to this process as one of social transmission illustrating it through reference to the way in which the elders of a tribe initiate younger members into the patterns of beliefs and practices of the group ", "Similarly where adults exercise a dominating influence over the growing child it is through social transmission that children can acquire knowledge ", "By contrast in cooperative relations power is more evenly distributed between participants so that a more symmetrical relationship emerges ", "Under these conditions authentic forms of intellectual exchange become possible each partner has the freedom to project his or her own thoughts consider the positions of others and defend his or her own point of view ", "In such circumstances where children s thinking is not limited by a dominant influence Piaget believed the reconstruction of knowledge or favorable conditions for the emergence of constructive solutions to problems exists ", "Here the knowledge that emerges is open flexible and regulated by the logic of argument rather than being determined by an external authority ", "In short cooperative relations provide the arena for the emergence of operations which for Piaget requires the absence of any constraining influence and is most often illustrated by the relations that form between peers for more on the importance of this distinction see Duveen Psaltis Psaltis Duveen ", "This is thus how according to Piaget children learn moral judgement as opposed to cultural norms or maybe ideological norms ", "Piaget s research on morality was highly influential in subsequent work on moral development particularly in the case of Lawrence Kohlberg s highly influential stage theory of moral development which dominated moral psychology research until the end of the twentieth century ", " Historical changes of thought have been modeled in Piagetian terms ", "Broadly speaking these models have mapped changes in morality intellectual life and cognitive levels against historical changes typically in the complexity of social systems ", "Notable examples include Neo Piagetian stages have been applied to the maximum stage attained by various animals ", "For example spiders attain the circular sensory motor stage coordinating actions and perceptions ", "Pigeons attain the sensory motor stage forming concepts ", " The origins of human intelligence have also been studied in Piagetian terms ", "Wynn analysed Acheulian and Oldowan tools in terms of the insight into spatial relationships required to create each kind ", "On a more general level Robinson s Birth of Reason suggests a large scale model for the emergence of a Piagetian intelligence ", "Piaget s models of cognition have also been applied outside the human sphere and some primatologists assess the development and abilities of primates in terms of Piaget s model ", " Philosophers have used Piaget s work ", "For example the philosopher and social theorist J rgen Habermas has incorporated Piaget into his work most notably in The Theory of Communicative Action ", "The philosopher Thomas Kuhn credited Piaget s work with helping him to understand the transition between modes of thought which characterized his theory of paradigm shifts ", " Yet that said it is also noted that the implications of his later work do indeed remain largely unexamined ", " Shortly before his death September Piaget was involved in a debate about the relationships between innate and acquired features of language at the Centre Royaumont pour une Science de l Homme where he discussed his point of view with the linguist Noam Chomsky as well as Hilary Putnam and Stephen Toulmin ", "Piaget also had a considerable effect in the field of computer science and artificial intelligence ", "Seymour Papert used Piaget s work while developing the Logo programming language ", "Alan Kay used Piaget s theories as the basis for the Dynabook programming system concept which was first discussed within the confines of the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center Xerox PARC ", "These discussions led to the development of the Alto prototype which explored for the first time all the elements of the graphical user interface GUI and influenced the creation of user interfaces in the s and beyond ", " Piaget s theories however have not gone without scrutiny ", "A main figure whose ideas contradicted Piaget s ideas was the Russian psychologist Lev Vygotsky ", "Vygotsky stressed the importance of a child s cultural background as an effect to the stages of development ", "Because different cultures stress different social interactions this challenged Piaget s theory that the hierarchy of learning development had to develop in succession ", "Vygotsky introduced the term Zone of proximal development as an overall task a child would have to develop that would be too difficult to develop alone ", "Also the so called neo Piagetian theories of cognitive development maintained that Piaget s theory does not do justice either to the underlying mechanisms of information processing that explain transition from stage to stage or individual differences in cognitive development ", "According to these theories changes in information processing mechanisms such as speed of processing and working memory are responsible for ascension from stage to stage ", "Moreover differences between individuals in these processes explain why some individuals develop faster than other individuals Demetriou ", "Over time alternative theories of child development have been put forward and empirical findings have done a lot to undermine Piaget s theories ", "For example Esther Thelen and colleagues found that babies would not make the A not B error if they had small weights added to their arms during the first phase of the experiment that were then removed before the second phase of the experiment ", "This minor change should not impact babies understanding of object permanence so the difference that this makes to babies performance on the A not B task cannot be explained by Piagetian theory ", "Thelen and colleagues also found that various other factors also influenced performance on the A not B task including strength of memory trace salience of targets waiting time and stance and proposed that this could be better explained using a dynamic systems theory approach than using Piagetian theory ", "Alison Gopnik and Betty Repacholi found that babies as young as months old can understand that other people have desires and that these desires could be very different from their own desires ", "This contradicts Piaget s view that children are very egocentric at this age ", "Furthermore modern cognitive science had undermined Piaget s view that young children are unable to comprehend number as they are not able to work with abstract concepts in the sensorimotor stage ", "This Piagetian view has led many educators to believe that it is not appropriate to teach simple arithmetic to young children as it will not lead to real understanding ", " However experiments by Starkey et al ", "have shown that children have an understanding of abstract numbers from as young as months old while more recent studies by Izard et al ", "have shown that even newborns can perceive abstract numbers ", " For a full discussion of this see Stanislas Dehaene s The Number Sense How the Mind Creates Mathematics ", " Some supporters of Piaget counter that his critics arguments depend on misreadings of Piaget s theory ", " See also Brian Rotman s Jean Piaget Psychologist of the Real an exposition and critique of Piaget s ideas and Jonathan Tudge and Barbara Rogoff s Peer influences on cognitive development Piagetian and Vygotskian perspectives ", " The following groupings are based on the number of citations in Google Scholar ", "CUNY pdfPiaget inspired innumerable studies and even new areas of inquiry ", "The following is a list of critiques and commentaries organized using the same citation based method as the list of his own major works above ", "These represent the significant and influential post Piagetian writings in their respective sub disciplines "]},

skeleton ", " The muscle cells of skeletal muscles are much longer than in the other types of muscle tissue and are often known as muscle fibers ", " The muscle tissue of a skeletal muscle is striated having a striped appearance due to the arrangement of the sarcomeres ", "Skeletal muscles are voluntary muscles under the control of the somatic nervous system ", "The other types of muscle are cardiac muscle which is also striated and smooth muscle which is non striated both of these types of muscle tissue are classified as involuntary or under the control of the autonomic nervous system ", " A skeletal muscle contains multiple fascicles bundles of muscle fibers ", "Each individual fiber and each muscle is surrounded by a type of connective tissue layer of fascia ", "Muscle fibers are formed from the fusion of developmental myoblasts in a process known as myogenesis resulting in long multinucleated cells ", "In these cells the nuclei termed myonuclei are located along the inside of the cell membrane ", "Muscle fibers also have multiple mitochondria to meet energy needs ", "Muscle fibers are in turn composed of myofibrils ", "The myofibrils are composed of actin and myosin filaments called myofilaments repeated in units called sarcomeres which are the basic functional contractile units of the muscle fiber necessary for muscle contraction ", " Muscles are predominantly powered by the oxidation of fats and carbohydrates but anaerobic chemical reactions are also used particularly by fast twitch fibers ", "These chemical reactions produce adenosine triphosphate ATP molecules that are used to power the movement of the myosin heads ", " There are more than skeletal muscles in the human body making up around to of body weight ", " Most muscles occur in bilaterally placed pairs to serve both sides of the body ", "Muscles are often classed as groups of muscles that work together to carry out an action ", "In the torso there are several major muscle groups including the pectoral and abdominal muscles intrinsic and extrinsic muscles are subdivisions of muscle groups in the hand foot tongue and extraocular muscles of the eye ", "Muscles are also grouped into compartments including four groups in the arm and the four groups in the leg ", "Apart from the contractile part of a muscle consisting of its fibers a muscle contains a non contractile part of dense fibrous connective tissue that makes up the tendon at each end ", "The tendons attach the muscles to bones to give skeletal movement ", "The length of a muscle includes the tendons ", "Connective tissue is present in all muscles as deep fascia ", "Deep fascia specialises within muscles to enclose each muscle fiber as endomysium each muscle fascicle as perimysium and each individual muscle as epimysium ", "Together these layers are called mysia ", "Deep fascia also separates the groups of muscles into muscle compartments ", "Two types of sensory receptors found in muscles are muscle spindles and Golgi tendon organs ", "Muscle spindles are stretch receptors located in the muscle belly ", "Golgi tendon organs are proprioceptors located at the myotendinous junction that inform of a muscle s tension ", "Skeletal muscle cells are the individual contractile cells within a muscle and are often termed as muscle fibers ", " A single muscle such as the biceps in a young adult male contains around muscle fibers ", " Skeletal muscle fibers are the only muscle cells that are multinucleated with the nuclei often referred to as myonuclei ", "This occurs during myogenesis with the fusion of myoblasts each contributing a nucleus ", " Fusion depends on muscle specific proteins known as fusogens called myomaker and myomerger ", " Many nuclei are needed by the skeletal muscle cell for the large amounts of proteins and enzymes needed to be produced for the cell s normal functioning ", "A single muscle fiber can contain from hundreds to thousands of nuclei ", " A muscle fiber for example in the human biceps with a length of cm can have as many as nuclei ", " Unlike in a non muscle cell where the nucleus is centrally positioned the myonucleus is elongated and located close to the sarcolemma ", "The myonuclei are quite uniformly arranged along the fiber with each nucleus having its own myonuclear domain where it is responsible for supporting the volume of cytoplasm in that particular section of the myofiber ", " A group of muscle stem cells known as myosatellite cells also satellite cells are found between the basement membrane and the sarcolemma of muscle fibers ", "These cells are normally quiescent but can be activated by exercise or pathology to provide additional myonuclei for muscle growth or repair ", " Muscles attach to tendons in a complex interface region known as the musculotendinous junction also known as the myotendinous junction an area specialised for the primary transmission of force ", " At the muscle tendon interface force is transmitted from the sarcomeres in the muscle cells to the tendon ", " Muscles and tendons develop in close association and after their joining at the myotendinous junction they constitute a dynamic unit for the transmission of force from muscle contraction to the skeletal system ", " Muscle architecture refers to the arrangement of muscle fibers relative to the axis of force generation which runs from a muscle s origin to its insertion ", "The usual arrangements are types of parallel and types of pennate muscle ", "In parallel muscles the fascicles run parallel to the axis of force generation but the fascicles can vary in their relationship to one another and to their tendons ", " These variations are seen in fusiform strap and convergent muscles ", " A convergent muscle has a triangular or fan shape as the fibers converge at its insertion and are fanned out broadly at the origin ", " A less common example of a parallel muscle is a circular muscle such as the orbicularis oculi in which the fibers are longitudinally arranged but create a circle from origin to insertion ", " These different architectures can cause variations in the tension that a muscle can create between its tendons ", "The fibers in pennate muscles run at an angle to the axis of force generation ", " This pennation angle reduces the effective force of any individual fiber as it is effectively pulling off axis ", "However because of this angle more fibers can be packed into the same muscle volume increasing the physiological cross sectional area PCSA ", "This effect is known as fiber packing and in terms of force generation it more than overcomes the efficiency loss of the off axis orientation ", "The trade off comes in overall speed of muscle shortening and in the total excursion ", "Overall muscle shortening speed is reduced compared to fiber shortening speed as is the total distance of shortening ", " All of these effects scale with pennation angle greater angles lead to greater force due to increased fiber packing and PCSA but with greater losses in shortening speed and excursion ", "Types of pennate muscle are unipennate bipennate and multipennate ", "A unipennate muscle has similarly angled fibers that are on one side of a tendon ", "A bipennate muscle has fibers on two sides of a tendon ", "Multipennate muscles have fibers that are oriented at multiple angles along the force generating axis and this is the most general and most common architecture ", " Muscle fibers grow when exercised and shrink when not in use ", "This is due to the fact that exercise stimulates the increase in myofibrils which increase the overall size of muscle cells ", "Well exercised muscles can not only add more size but can also develop more mitochondria myoglobin glycogen and a higher density of capillaries ", "However muscle cells cannot divide to produce new cells and as a result there are fewer muscle cells in an adult than in a newborn ", " There are a number of terms used in the naming of muscles including those relating to size shape action location their orientation and their number of heads ", "Broadly there are two types of muscle fiber Type I which is slow and Type II which are fast ", "Type II has two divisions of type IIA oxidative and type IIX glycolytic giving three main fiber types ", " These fibers have relatively distinct metabolic contractile and motor unit properties ", "The table below differentiates these types of properties ", "These types of properties while they are partly dependent on the properties of individual fibers tend to be relevant and measured at the level of the motor unit rather than individual fiber ", " Traditionally fibers were categorized depending on their varying color which is a reflection of myoglobin content ", "Type I fibers appear red due to the high levels of myoglobin ", "Red muscle fibers tend to have more mitochondria and greater local capillary density ", "These fibers are more suited for endurance and are slow to fatigue because they use oxidative metabolism to generate ATP adenosine triphosphate ", "Less oxidative Type II fibers are white due to relatively low myoglobin and a reliance on glycolytic enzymes ", "Fibers can also be classified on their twitch capabilities into fast and slow twitch ", "These traits largely but not completely overlap the classifications based on color ATPase or MHC ", "Some authors define a fast twitch fiber as one in which the myosin can split ATP very quickly ", "These mainly include the ATPase type II and MHC type II fibers ", "However fast twitch fibers also demonstrate a higher capability for electrochemical transmission of action potentials and a rapid level of calcium release and uptake by the sarcoplasmic reticulum ", "The fast twitch fibers rely on a well developed anaerobic short term glycolytic system for energy transfer and can contract and develop tension at times the rate of slow twitch fibers ", "Fast twitch muscles are much better at generating short bursts of strength or speed than slow muscles and so fatigue more quickly ", " The slow twitch fibers generate energy for ATP re synthesis by means of a long term system of aerobic energy transfer ", "These mainly include the ATPase type I and MHC type I fibers ", "They tend to have a low activity level of ATPase a slower speed of contraction with a less well developed glycolytic capacity ", " Fibers that become slow twitch develop greater numbers of mitochondria and capillaries making them better for prolonged work ", " Individual muscles tend to be a mixture of various fiber types but their proportions vary depending on the actions of that muscle ", "For instance in humans the quadriceps muscles contain type I fibers while the soleus is type I ", " The orbicularis oculi muscle of the eye is only type I ", " Motor units within the muscle however have minimal variation between the fibers of that unit ", "It is this fact that makes the size principal of motor unit recruitment viable ", "The total number of skeletal muscle fibers has traditionally been thought not to change ", "It is believed there are no sex or age differences in fiber distribution however proportions of fiber types vary considerably from muscle to muscle and person to person ", " citation needed Among different species there is much variation in the proportions of muscle fiber types ", " Sedentary men and women as well as young children have type II and type I fibers ", " citation needed People at the higher end of any sport tend to demonstrate patterns of fiber distribution e g ", "endurance athletes show a higher level of type I fibers ", "Sprint athletes on the other hand require large numbers of type IIX fibers ", "Middle distance event athletes show approximately equal distribution of the two types ", "This is also often the case for power athletes such as throwers and jumpers ", "It has been suggested that various types of exercise can induce changes in the fibers of a skeletal muscle ", " It is thought that if you perform endurance type events for a sustained period of time some of the type IIX fibers transform into type IIA fibers ", "However there is no consensus on the subject ", " citation needed It may well be that the type IIX fibers show enhancements of the oxidative capacity after high intensity endurance training which brings them to a level at which they are able to perform oxidative metabolism as effectively as slow twitch fibers of untrained subjects ", "This would be brought about by an increase in mitochondrial size and number and the associated related changes not a change in fiber type ", "There are numerous methods employed for fiber typing and confusion between the methods is common among non experts ", "Two commonly confused methods are histochemical staining for myosin ATPase activity and immunohistochemical staining for myosin heavy chain MHC type ", "Myosin ATPase activity is commonly and correctly referred to as simply fiber type and results from the direct assaying of ATPase activity under various conditions e g ", "pH ", " Myosin heavy chain staining is most accurately referred to as MHC fiber type e g ", " MHC IIa fibers and results from determination of different MHC isoforms ", " These methods are closely related physiologically as the MHC type is the primary determinant of ATPase activity ", "However neither of these typing methods is directly metabolic in nature they do not directly address oxidative or glycolytic capacity of the fiber ", "When type I or type II fibers are referred to generically this most accurately refers to the sum of numerical fiber types I vs II as assessed by myosin ATPase activity staining e g ", " type II fibers refers to type IIA type IIAX type IIXA ", "etc ", "Below is a table showing the relationship between these two methods limited to fiber types found in humans ", "Subtype capitalization is used in fiber typing vs MHC typing and some ATPase types actually contain multiple MHC types ", "Also a subtype B or b is not expressed in humans by either method ", " Early researchers believed humans to express a MHC IIb which led to the ATPase classification of IIB ", "However later research showed that the human MHC IIb was in fact IIx indicating that the IIB is better named IIX ", "IIb is expressed in other mammals so is still accurately seen along with IIB in the literature ", "Non human fiber types include true IIb fibers IIc IId etc ", "Further fiber typing methods are less formally delineated and exist on more of a spectrum ", "They tend to be focused more on metabolic and functional capacities i e oxidative vs glycolytic fast vs slow contraction time ", "As noted above fiber typing by ATPase or MHC does not directly measure or dictate these parameters ", "However many of the various methods are mechanistically linked while others are correlated in vivo ", " For instance ATPase fiber type is related to contraction speed because high ATPase activity allows faster crossbridge cycling ", " While ATPase activity is only one component of contraction speed Type I fibers are slow in part because they have low speeds of ATPase activity in comparison to Type II fibers ", "However measuring contraction speed is not the same as ATPase fiber typing ", "Almost all multicellular animals depend on muscles to move ", " Generally muscular systems of most multicellular animals comprise both slow twitch and fast twitch muscle fibers though the proportions of each fiber type can vary across organisms and environments ", "The ability to shift their phenotypic fiber type proportions through training and responding to the environment has served organisms well when placed in changing environments either requiring short explosive movements higher fast twitch proportion or long duration of movement higher slow twitch proportion to survive ", " Bodybuilding has shown that changes in muscle mass and force production can change in a matter of months ", " Some examples of this variation are described below ", " American lobster Homarus americanus has three fiber types including fast twitch fibers

myosin heavy chain isotype is a major determinant of the specific fiber type ", "In zebrafish embryos the first muscle fibers to form are the slow twitch fibers ", "These cells will undergo migration from their original location to form a monolayer of slow twitch muscle fibers ", "These muscle fibers undergo further differentiation as the embryo matures ", " In larger animals different muscle groups will increasingly require different fiber type proportions within muscle for different purposes ", "Turtles such as Trachemys scripta elegans have complementary muscles within the neck that show a potential inverse trend of fiber type percentages one muscle has high percentage of fast twitch while the complementary muscle will have a higher percentage of slow twitch fibers ", "The complementary muscles of turtles had similar percentages of fiber types ", " Chimpanzee muscles are composed of fast twitch fibers and have a maximum dynamic force and power output times higher than human muscles of similar size ", "Among mammals there is a predominance of type II fibers utilizing glycolytic metabolism ", "Because of the discrepancy in fast twitch fibers compared to humans

the composition of muscle fiber types is flexible and can vary with a number of different environmental factors ", "This plasticity can arguably be the strongest evolutionary advantage among organisms with muscle ", "In fish different fiber types are expressed at different water temperatures ", " Cold temperatures require more efficient metabolism within muscle and fatigue resistance is important ", "While in more tropical environments fast powerful movements from higher fast twitch proportions may prove more beneficial in the long run ", " In rodents such as rats the transitory nature of their muscle is highly prevalent ", "They have high percentage of hybrid muscle fibers and have up to in fast to slow transforming muscle ", " Environmental influences such as diet exercise and lifestyle types have a pivotal role in proportions of fiber type in humans ", "Aerobic exercise will shift the proportions towards slow twitch fibers while explosive powerlifting and sprinting will transition fibers towards fast twitch ", " In animals exercise training will look more like the need for long durations of movement or short explosive movements to escape predators or catch prey ", " Skeletal muscle exhibits a distinctive banding pattern when viewed under the microscope due to the arrangement of two contractile proteins myosin and actin that are two of the myofilaments in the myofibrils ", "The myosin forms the thick filaments and actin forms the thin filaments and are arranged in repeating units called sarcomeres ", "The interaction of both proteins results in muscle contraction ", "The sarcomere is attached to other organelles such as the mitochondria by intermediate filaments in the cytoskeleton ", "The costamere attaches the sarcomere to the sarcolemma ", " Every single organelle and macromolecule of a muscle fiber is arranged to ensure that it meets desired functions ", "The cell membrane is called the sarcolemma with the cytoplasm known as the sarcoplasm ", "In the sarcoplasm are the myofibrils ", "The myofibrils are long protein bundles about one micrometer in diameter ", "Pressed against the inside of the sarcolemma are the unusual flattened myonuclei ", "Between the myofibrils are the mitochondria ", "While the muscle fiber does not have smooth endoplasmic cisternae it contains sarcoplasmic reticulum ", "The sarcoplasmic reticulum surrounds the myofibrils and holds a reserve of the calcium ions needed to cause a muscle contraction ", "Periodically it has dilated end sacs known as terminal cisternae ", "These cross the muscle fiber from one side to the other ", "In between two terminal cisternae is a tubular infolding called a transverse tubule T tubule ", "T tubules are the pathways for action potentials to signal the sarcoplasmic reticulum to release calcium causing a muscle contraction ", "Together two terminal cisternae and a transverse tubule form a triad ", " All muscles are derived from paraxial mesoderm ", "During embryonic development in the process of somitogenesis the paraxial mesoderm is divided along the embryo s length to form somites corresponding to the segmentation of the body most obviously seen in the vertebral column ", " Each somite has three divisions sclerotome which forms vertebrae dermatome which forms skin and myotome which forms muscle ", "The myotome is divided into two sections the epimere and hypomere which form epaxial and hypaxial muscles respectively ", "The only epaxial muscles in humans are the erector spinae and small vertebral muscles and are innervated by the dorsal rami of the spinal nerves ", "All other muscles including those of the limbs are hypaxial and innervated by the ventral rami of the spinal nerves ", " During development myoblasts muscle progenitor cells either remain in the somite to form muscles associated with the vertebral column or migrate out into the body to form all other muscles ", "Myoblast migration is preceded by the

units ", "Muscle fibers aresubject to depolarization by the neurotransmitter acetylcholine released by the motor neurons at the neuromuscular junctions ", " In addition to the actin and myosin myofilaments in the myofibrils that make up the contractile sarcomeres there are two other important regulatory proteins troponin and tropomyosin that make muscle contraction possible ", "These proteins are associated with actin and cooperate to prevent its interaction with myosin ", "Once a cell is sufficiently stimulated the cell s sarcoplasmic reticulum releases ionic calcium Ca which then interacts with the regulatory protein troponin ", "Calcium bound troponin undergoes a conformational change that leads to the movement of tropomyosin subsequently exposing the myosin binding sites on actin ", "This allows for myosin and actin ATP dependent cross bridge cycling and shortening of the muscle ", "Excitation contraction coupling is the process by which a muscular action potential in the muscle fiber causes the myofibrils to contract ", "This process relies on a direct coupling between the sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium release channel RYR ryanodine receptor and voltage gated L type calcium channels identified as dihydropyridine receptors DHPRs ", "DHPRs are located on the sarcolemma which includes the surface sarcolemma and the transverse tubules while the RyRs reside across the SR membrane ", "The close apposition of a transverse tubule and two SR regions containing RyRs is described as a triad and is predominantly where excitation contraction coupling takes place ", "Excitation contraction coupling occurs when depolarization of skeletal muscle cell results in a muscle action potential which spreads across the cell surface and into the muscle fiber s network of T tubules thereby depolarizing the inner portion of the muscle fiber ", "Depolarization of the inner portions activates dihydropyridine receptors in the terminal cisternae which are close to ryanodine receptors in the adjacent sarcoplasmic reticulum ", "The activated dihydropyridine receptors physically interact with ryanodine receptors to activate them via foot processes involving

signal from the afferent fiber does not reach the brain but produces the reflexive movement by direct connections with the efferent nerves in the spine ", "However the majority of muscle activity is volitional and the result of complex interactions between various areas of the brain ", "Nerves that control skeletal muscles in mammals correspond with neuron groups along the primary motor cortex of

accounts for much of the body s energy consumption ", "All muscle cells produce adenosine triphosphate ATP molecules which are used to power the movement of the myosin heads ", "Muscles have a short term store of energy in the form of creatine phosphate which is generated from ATP and can regenerate ATP when needed with creatine kinase ", "Muscles also keep a storage form of glucose in the form of glycogen ", "Glycogen can be rapidly converted to glucose when energy is required for sustained powerful contractions ", "Within the voluntary skeletal muscles the glucose molecule can be metabolized anaerobically in a process called glycolysis which produces two ATP and two lactic acid molecules in the process note that in aerobic conditions lactate is not formed instead pyruvate is formed and transmitted through the citric acid cycle ", "Muscle cells also contain globules of fat which are used for energy during aerobic exercise ", "The aerobic energy systems take longer to produce the ATP and reach peak efficiency and requires many more biochemical steps but produces significantly more ATP than anaerobic glycolysis ", "Cardiac muscle on the other hand can readily

the Swiss developmental psychologist Jean Piaget ", "The theory deals with the nature of knowledge itself and how humans gradually come to acquire construct and use it ", " Piaget s theory is mainly known as a developmental stage theory ", "In while working at the Alfred Binet Laboratory School in Paris Piaget was intrigued by the fact that children of different ages made different kinds of mistakes while solving problems ", " His experience and observations at the Alfred Binet Laboratory were the beginnings of his theory of cognitive development ", " He believed that children of different ages made different mistakes because of the quality rather than quantity of their intelligence ", " Piaget proposed four stages to describe the development process of children sensorimotor stage pre operational stage concrete operational stage and formal operational stage ", " Each stage describes a specific age group ", "In each stage he described how children develop their cognitive skills ", "For example he believed that children experience the world through actions representing things with words thinking logically and using reasoning ", "To Piaget cognitive development was a progressive reorganization of mental processes resulting from biological maturation and environmental experience ", "He believed that children construct an understanding of the world around them experience discrepancies between what they already know and what they discover in their environment then adjust their ideas accordingly ", " Moreover Piaget claimed that cognitive development is at the center of the human organism and language is contingent on knowledge and understanding acquired through cognitive development ", " Piaget s earlier work received the greatest attention ", "Child centered classrooms and open education are direct applications of Piaget s views ", " Despite its huge success Piaget s theory has some limitations that Piaget recognized himself for example the theory supports sharp stages rather than continuous development horizontal and vertical d calage ", " Piaget noted that reality is a dynamic system of continuous change ", "Reality is defined in reference to the two conditions that define dynamic systems ", "Specifically he argued that reality involves transformations and states ", " Transformations refer to all manners of changes that a thing or person can undergo ", "States refer to the conditions or the appearances in which things or persons can be found between transformations ", "For example there might be changes in shape or form for instance liquids are reshaped as they are transferred from one vessel to another and similarly humans change in their characteristics as they grow older in size a toddler does not walk and run without falling but after yrs of age the child s sensorimotor anatomy is well developed and now acquires skill faster or in placement or location in space and time e g various objects or persons might be found at one place at one time and at a different place at another time ", "Thus Piaget argued if human intelligence is to be adaptive it must have functions to represent both the transformational and the static aspects of reality ", " He proposed that operative intelligence is responsible for the representation and manipulation of the dynamic or transformational aspects of reality and that figurative intelligence is responsible for the representation of the static aspects of reality ", " Operative intelligence is the active aspect of intelligence ", "It involves all actions overt or covert undertaken in order to follow recover or anticipate the transformations of the objects or persons of interest ", " Figurative intelligence is the more or less static aspect of intelligence involving all means of representation used to retain in mind the states i e successive forms shapes or locations that intervene between transformations ", "That is it involves perception imitation mental imagery drawing and language ", " Therefore the figurative aspects of intelligence derive their meaning from the operative aspects of intelligence because states cannot exist independently of the transformations that interconnect them ", "Piaget stated that the figurative or the representational aspects of intelligence are subservient to its operative and dynamic aspects and therefore that understanding essentially derives from the operative aspect of intelligence ", " At any time operative intelligence frames how the world is understood and it changes if understanding is not successful ", "Piaget stated that this process of understanding and change involves two basic functions assimilation and accommodation ", " Through his study of the field of education Piaget focused on two processes which he named assimilation and accommodation ", "To Piaget assimilation meant integrating external elements into structures of lives or environments or those we could have through experience ", " Assimilation is how humans perceive and adapt to new information ", "It is the process of fitting new information into pre existing cognitive schemas ", " Assimilation in which new experiences are reinterpreted to fit into or assimilate with old ideas and analyzing new facts accordingly ", " It occurs when humans are faced with new or unfamiliar information and refer to previously learned information in order to make sense of it ", "In contrast accommodation is the process of taking new information in one s environment and altering pre existing schemas in order to fit in the new information ", "This happens when the existing schema knowledge does not work and needs to be changed to deal with a new object or situation ", " Accommodation is imperative because it is how people will continue to interpret new concepts schemas frameworks and more ", " Piaget believed that the human brain has been programmed through evolution to bring equilibrium which is what he believed ultimately influences structures by the internal and external processes through assimilation and accommodation ", " Piaget s understanding was that assimilation and accommodation cannot exist without the other ", " They are two sides of a coin ", "To assimilate an object into an existing mental schema one first needs to take into account or accommodate to the particularities of this object to a certain extent ", "For instance to recognize assimilate an apple as an apple one must first focus accommodate on the contour of this object ", "To do this one needs to roughly recognize the size of the object ", "Development increases the balance or equilibration between these two functions ", "When in balance with each other assimilation and accommodation generate mental schemas of the operative intelligence ", "When one function dominates over the other they generate representations which belong to figurative intelligence ", " In his theory of cognitive development Jean Piaget proposed that humans progress through four developmental stages the sensorimotor stage preoperational stage concrete operational stage and formal operational stage ", " The first of these the sensorimotor stage extends from birth to the acquisition of language ", " In this stage infants progressively construct knowledge and understanding of the world by coordinating experiences such as vision and hearing from physical interactions with objects such as grasping sucking and stepping ", " Infants gain knowledge of the world from the physical actions they perform within it ", " They progress from reflexive instinctual action at birth to the beginning of symbolic thought toward the end of the stage ", " Children learn that they are separate from the environment ", "They can think about aspects of the environment even though these may be outside the reach of the child s senses ", "In this stage according to Piaget the development of object permanence is one of the most important accomplishments ", " Object permanence is a child s understanding that an object continues to exist even though they cannot see or hear it ", " Peek a boo is a game in which children who have yet to fully develop object permanence respond to sudden hiding and revealing of a face ", "By the end of the sensorimotor period children develop a permanent sense of self and object and will quickly lose interest in Peek a boo ", " Piaget divided the sensorimotor stage into six sub stages ", " By observing sequences of play Piaget was able to demonstrate the second stage of his theory the pre operational stage ", "He said that this stage starts towards the end of the second year ", "It starts when the child begins to learn to speak and lasts up until the age of seven ", "During the pre operational stage of cognitive development Piaget noted that children do not yet understand concrete logic and cannot mentally manipulate information ", " Children s increase in playing and pretending takes place in this stage ", "However the child still has trouble seeing things from different points of view ", "The children s play is mainly categorized by symbolic play and manipulating symbols ", "Such play is demonstrated by the idea of checkers being snacks pieces of paper being plates and a box being a table ", "Their observations of symbols exemplifies the idea of play with the absence of the actual objects involved ", "The pre operational stage is sparse and logically inadequate in regard to mental operations ", "The child is able to form stable concepts as well as magical beliefs magical thinking ", "The child however is still not able to perform operations which are tasks that the child can do mentally rather than physically ", "Thinking in this stage is still egocentric meaning the child has difficulty seeing the viewpoint of others ", "The Pre operational Stage is split into two substages the symbolic function substage and the intuitive thought substage ", "The symbolic function substage is when children are able to understand represent remember and picture objects in their mind without having the object in front of them ", "The intuitive thought substage is when children tend to propose the questions of why ", "and how come ", "This stage is when children want to understand everything ", " At about two to four years of age children cannot yet manipulate and transform information in a logical way ", "However they now can think in images and symbols ", "Other examples of mental abilities are language and pretend play ", "Symbolic play is when children develop imaginary friends or role play with friends ", "Children s play becomes more social and they assign roles to each other ", "Some examples of symbolic play include playing house or having a tea party ", "The type of symbolic play in which children engage is connected with their level of creativity and ability to connect with others ", " Additionally the quality of their symbolic play can have consequences on their later development ", "For example young children whose symbolic play is of a violent nature tend to exhibit less prosocial behavior and are more likely to display antisocial tendencies in later years ", " In this stage there are still limitations such as egocentrism and precausal thinking ", "Egocentrism occurs when a child is unable to distinguish between their own perspective and that of another person ", "Children tend to stick to their own viewpoint rather than consider the view of others ", "Indeed they are not even aware that such a concept as different viewpoints exists ", " Egocentrism can be seen in an experiment performed by Piaget and Swiss developmental psychologist B rbel Inhelder known as the three mountain problem ", "In this experiment three views of a mountain are shown to the child who is asked what a traveling doll would see at the various angles ", "The child will consistently describe what they can see from the position from which they are seated regardless of the angle from which they are asked to take the doll s perspective ", "Egocentrism would also cause a child to believe I like Sesame Street so Daddy must like Sesame Street too ", "Similar to preoperational children s egocentric thinking is their structuring of a cause and effect relationships ", "Piaget coined the term precausal thinking to describe the way in which preoperational children use their own existing ideas or views like in egocentrism to explain cause and effect relationships ", "Three main concepts of causality as displayed by children in the preoperational stage include animism artificialism and transductive reasoning ", " Animism is the belief that inanimate objects are capable of actions and have lifelike qualities ", "An example could be a child believing that the sidewalk was mad and made them fall down or that the stars twinkle in the sky because they are happy ", "Artificialism refers to the belief that environmental characteristics can be attributed to human actions or interventions ", "For example a child might say that it is windy outside because someone is blowing very hard or the clouds are white because someone painted them that color ", "Finally precausal thinking is categorized by transductive reasoning ", "Transductive reasoning is when a child fails to understand the true relationships between cause and effect ", " Unlike deductive or inductive reasoning general to specific or specific to general transductive reasoning refers to when a child reasons from specific to specific drawing a relationship between two separate events that are otherwise unrelated ", "For example if a child hears the dog bark and then a balloon popped the child would conclude that because the dog barked the balloon popped ", "A main feature of the pre operational stage of development is primitive reasoning ", "Between the ages of four and seven reasoning changes from symbolic thought to intuitive thought ", "This stage is marked by greater dependence on intuitive thinking rather than just perception ", " Children begin to have more automatic thoughts that don t require evidence ", "During this stage there is a heightened sense of curiosity and need to understand how and why things work ", "Piaget named this substage intuitive thought because they are starting to develop more logical thought but cannot explain their reasoning ", " Thought during this stage is still immature and cognitive errors occur ", "Children in this stage depend on their own subjective perception of the object or event ", " This stage is characterized by centration conservation irreversibility class inclusion and transitive inference ", "Centration is the act of focusing all attention on one characteristic or dimension of a situation whilst disregarding all others ", "Conservation is the awareness that altering a substance s appearance does not change its basic properties ", "Children at this stage are unaware of conservation and exhibit centration ", "Both centration and conservation can be more easily understood once familiarized with Piaget s most famous experimental task ", "In this task a child is presented with two identical beakers containing the same amount of liquid ", "The child usually notes that the beakers do contain the same amount of liquid ", "When one of the beakers is poured into a taller and thinner container children who are younger than seven or eight years old typically say that the two beakers no longer contain the same amount of liquid and that the taller container holds the larger quantity centration without taking into consideration the fact that both beakers were previously noted to contain the same amount of liquid ", "Due to superficial changes the child was unable to comprehend that the properties of the substances continued to remain the same conservation ", "Irreversibility is a concept developed in this stage which is closely related to the ideas of centration and conservation ", "Irreversibility refers to when children are unable to mentally reverse a sequence of events ", "In the same beaker situation the child does not realize that if the sequence of events was reversed and the water from the tall beaker was poured back into its original beaker then the same amount of water would exist ", "Another example of children s reliance on visual representations is their misunderstanding of less than or more than ", "When two rows containing equal numbers of blocks are placed in front of a child one row spread farther apart than the other the child will think that the row spread farther contains more blocks ", " Class inclusion refers to a kind of conceptual thinking that children in the preoperational stage cannot yet grasp ", "Children s inability to focus on two aspects of a situation at once inhibits them from understanding the principle that one category or class can contain several different subcategories or classes ", " For example a four year old girl may be shown a picture of eight dogs and three cats ", "The girl knows what cats and dogs are and she is aware that they are both animals ", "However when asked Are there more dogs or animals ", "she is likely to answer more dogs ", "This is due to her difficulty focusing on the two subclasses and the larger class all at the same time ", "She may have been able to view the dogs as dogs or animals but struggled when trying to classify them as both simultaneously ", " Similar to this is concept relating to intuitive thought known as transitive inference ", "Transitive inference is using previous knowledge to determine the missing piece using basic logic ", "Children in the preoperational stage lack this logic ", "An example of transitive inference would be when a child is presented with the information A is greater than B and B is greater than C ", "This child may have difficulty here understanding that A is also greater than C ", "The concrete operational stage is the third stage of Piaget s theory of cognitive development ", "This stage which follows the preoperational stage occurs between the ages of and middle childhood and preadolescence years and is characterized by the appropriate use of logic ", "During this stage a child s thought processes become more mature and adult like ", "They start solving problems in a more logical fashion ", "Abstract hypothetical thinking is not yet developed in the child and children can only solve problems that apply to concrete events or objects ", "At this stage the children undergo a transition where the child learns rules such as conservation ", " Piaget determined that children are able to incorporate inductive reasoning ", "Inductive reasoning involves drawing inferences from observations in order to make a generalization ", "In contrast children struggle with deductive reasoning which involves using a generalized principle in order to try to predict the outcome of an event ", "Children in this stage commonly experience difficulties with figuring out logic in their heads ", "For example a child will understand that A is more than B and B is more than C ", "However when asked is A more than C ", " the child might not be able to logically figure the question out mentally ", "Two other important processes in the concrete operational stage are logic and the elimination of egocentrism ", "Egocentrism is the inability to consider or understand a perspective other than one s own ", "It is the phase where the thought and morality of the child is completely self focused ", " During this stage the child acquires the ability to view things from another individual s perspective even if they think that perspective is incorrect ", "For instance show a child a comic in which Jane puts a doll under a box leaves the room and then Melissa moves the doll to a drawer and Jane comes back ", "A child in the concrete operations stage will say that Jane will still think it s under the box even though the child knows it is in the drawer ", " See also False belief task ", "Children in this stage can however only solve problems that apply to actual concrete objects or events and not abstract concepts or hypothetical tasks ", "Understanding and knowing how to use full common sense has not yet been completely adapted ", "Piaget determined that children in the concrete operational stage were able to incorporate inductive logic ", "On the other hand children at this age have difficulty using deductive logic which involves using a general principle to predict the outcome of a specific event ", "This includes mental reversibility ", "An example of this is being able to reverse the order of relationships between mental categories ", "For example a child might be able to recognize that his or her dog is a Labrador that a Labrador is a dog and that a dog is an animal and draw conclusions from the information available as well as apply all these processes to hypothetical situations ", " The abstract quality of the adolescent s thought at the formal operational level is evident in the adolescent s verbal problem solving ability ", " The logical quality of the adolescent s thought is when children are more likely to solve problems in a trial and error fashion ", " Adolescents begin to think more as a scientist thinks devising plans to solve problems and systematically test opinions ", " They use hypothetical deductive reasoning which means that they develop hypotheses or best guesses and systematically deduce or conclude which is the best path to follow in solving the problem ", " During this stage the adolescent is able to understand love logical proofs and values ", "During this stage the young person begins to entertain possibilities for the future and is fascinated with what they can be ", " Adolescents also are changing cognitively by the way that they think about social matters ", "One thing that brings about a change is egocentrism ", "This happens by heightening self consciousness and giving adolescents an idea of who they are through their personal uniqueness and invincibility ", "Adolescent egocentrism can be dissected into two types of social thinking imaginary audience and personal fable ", "Imaginary audience consists of an adolescent believing that others are watching them and the things they do ", "Personal fable is not the same thing as imaginary audience but is often confused with imaginary audience ", "Personal fable consists of believing that you are exceptional in some way ", "These types of social thinking begin in the concrete stage but carry on to the formal operational stage of development ", "Piagetian tests are well known and practiced to test for concrete operations ", "The most prevalent tests are those for conservation ", "There are some important aspects that the experimenter must take into account when performing experiments with these children ", "One example of an experiment for testing conservation is the water level task ", "An experimenter will have two glasses that are the same size fill them to the same level with liquid and make sure the child understands that both of the glasses have the same amount of water in them ", "Then the experimenter will pour the liquid from one of the small glasses into a tall thin glass ", "The experimenter will then ask the child if the taller glass has more liquid less liquid or the same amount of liquid ", "The child will then give his answer ", "There are three keys for the experimenter to keep in mind with this experiment ", "These are justification number of times asking and word choice ", "These new cognitive skills increase the child s understanding of the physical world ", "However according to Piaget they still cannot think in abstract ways ", "Additionally they do not think in systematic scientific ways ", "For example most children under age twelve would not be able to come up with the variables that influence the period that a pendulum takes to complete its arc ", "Even if they were given weights they could attach to strings in order to do this experiment they would not be able to draw a clear conclusion ", " The final stage is known as the formal operational stage early to middle adolescence beginning at age and finalizing around Intelligence is demonstrated through the logical use of symbols related to abstract concepts ", "This form of thought includes assumptions that have no necessary relation to reality ", " At this point the person is capable of hypothetical and deductive reasoning ", "During this time people develop the ability to think about abstract concepts ", "Piaget stated that hypothetico deductive reasoning becomes important during the formal operational stage ", "This type of thinking involves hypothetical what if situations that are not always rooted in reality i e ", "counterfactual thinking ", "It is often required in science and mathematics ", "Children in primary school years mostly use inductive reasoning but adolescents start to use deductive reasoning ", "Inductive reasoning is when children draw general conclusions from personal experiences and specific facts ", "Adolescents learn how to use deductive reasoning by applying logic to create specific conclusions from abstract concepts ", "This capability results from their capacity to think hypothetically ", " However research has shown that not all persons in all cultures reach formal operations and most people do not use formal operations in all aspects of their lives ", " Piaget and his colleagues conducted several experiments to assess formal operational thought ", " In one of the experiments Piaget evaluated the cognitive capabilities of children of different ages through the use of a scale and varying weights ", "The task was to balance the scale by hooking weights on the ends of the scale ", "To successfully complete the task the children must use formal operational thought to realize that the distance of the weights from the center and the heaviness of the weights both affected the balance ", "A heavier weight has to be placed closer to the center of the scale and a lighter weight has to be placed farther from the center so that the two weights balance each other ", " While to year olds could not at all comprehend the concept of balancing children by the age of could balance the scale by placing the same weights on both ends but they failed to realize the importance of the location ", "By age children could think about location but failed to use logic and instead used trial and error ", "Finally by age and in early to middle adolescence some children more clearly understood the relationship between weight and distance and could successfully implement their hypothesis ", " Piaget sees children s conception of causation as a march from primitive conceptions of cause to those of a more scientific rigorous and mechanical nature ", "These primitive concepts are characterized as supernatural with a decidedly non natural or non mechanical tone ", "Piaget has as his most basic assumption that babies are phenomenists ", "That is their knowledge consists of assimilating things to schemas from their own action such that they appear from the child s point of view to have qualities which in fact stem from the organism ", "Consequently these subjective conceptions so prevalent during Piaget s first stage of development are dashed upon discovering deeper empirical truths ", "Piaget gives the example of a child believing that the moon and stars follow him on a night walk ", "Upon learning that such is the case for his friends he must separate his self from the object resulting in a theory that the moon is immobile or moves independently of other agents ", "The second stage from around three to eight years of age is characterized by a mix of this type of magical animistic or non natural conceptions of causation and mechanical or naturalistic causation ", "This conjunction of natural and non natural causal explanations supposedly stems from experience itself though Piaget does not make much of an attempt to describe the nature of the differences in conception ", "In his interviews with children he asked questions specifically about natural phenomena such as What makes clouds move ", " What makes the stars move ", " Why do rivers flow ", "The nature of all the answers given Piaget says are such that these objects must perform their actions to fulfill their obligations towards men ", "He calls this moral explanation ", " In Piaget considered the possibility of RNA molecules as likely embodiments of his still abstract schemas which he promoted as units of action though he did not come to any firm conclusion ", " At that time due to work such as that of Swedish biochemist Holger Hyd n RNA concentrations had indeed been shown to correlate with learning ", " citation needed Parents can use Piaget s theory in many ways to support their child s growth ", " Teachers can also use Piaget s theory to help their students ", "For example recent studies have shown that children in the same grade and of the same age perform differently on tasks measuring basic addition and subtraction accuracy ", " Children in the preoperational and concrete operational levels of cognitive development perform arithmetic operations such as addition and subtraction with similar accuracy however children in the concrete operational level have been able to perform both addition problems and subtraction problems with overall greater precision ", " Teachers can use Piaget s theory to see where each child in their class stands with each subject by discussing the syllabus with their students and the students parents ", " The stage of cognitive growth of a person differ from another ", "Cognitive development or thinking is an active process from the beginning to the end of life ", "Intellectual advancement happens because people at every age and developmental period look for cognitive equilibrium ", "To achieve this balance the easiest way is to understand the new experiences through the lens of the preexisting ideas ", "Infants learn that new objects can be grabbed in the same way of familiar objects and adults explain the day s headlines as evidence for their existing worldview ", " However the application of standardized Piagetian theory and procedures in different societies established widely varying results that lead some to speculate not only that some cultures produce more cognitive development than others but that without specific kinds of cultural experience but also formal schooling development might cease at certain level such as concrete operational level ", " citation needed A procedure was done following methods developed in Geneva i e ", "water level task ", "Participants were presented with two beakers of equal circumference and height filled with equal amounts of water ", "The water from one beaker was transferred into another with taller and smaller circumference ", "The children and young adults from non literate societies of a given age were more likely to think that the taller thinner beaker had more water in it ", "On the other hand an experiment on the effects of modifying testing procedures to match local cultural produced a different pattern of results ", "In the revised procedures the participants explained in their own language and indicated that while the water was now more the quantity was the same ", " Piaget s water level task has also been applied to the elderly by Formann and results showed an age associated non linear decline of performance ", " Researchers have linked Piaget s theory to Cattell and Horn s theory of fluid and crystallized abilities ", " Piaget s operative intelligence corresponds to the Cattell Horn formulation of fluid ability in that both concern logical thinking and the eduction of relations an expression Cattell used to refer to the inferring of relationships ", "Piaget s treatment of everyday learning corresponds to the Cattell Horn formulation of crystallized ability in that both reflect the impress of experience ", "Piaget s operativity is considered to be prior to and ultimately provides the foundation for everyday learning much like fluid ability s relation to crystallized intelligence ", " Piaget s theory also aligns with another psychometric theory namely the psychometric theory of g general intelligence ", "Piaget designed a number of tasks to assess hypotheses arising from his theory ", "The tasks were not intended to measure individual differences and they have no equivalent in psychometric intelligence tests ", "Notwithstanding the different research traditions in which psychometric tests and Piagetian tasks were developed the correlations between the two types of measures have been found to be consistently positive and generally moderate in magnitude ", "g is thought to underlie performance on the two types of tasks ", "It has been shown that it is possible to construct a battery consisting of Piagetian tasks that is as good a measure of g as standard IQ tests ", " Piagetian accounts of development have been challenged on several grounds ", "First as Piaget himself noted development does not always progress in the smooth manner his theory seems to predict ", "D calage or progressive forms of cognitive developmental progression in a specific domain suggest that the stage model is at best a useful approximation ", " Furthermore studies have found that children may be able to learn concepts and capability of complex reasoning that supposedly represented in more advanced stages with relative ease Louren o Machado p ", " More broadly Piaget s theory is domain general predicting that cognitive maturation occurs concurrently across different domains of knowledge such as mathematics logic and understanding of physics or language ", " Piaget did not take into account variability in a child s performance notably how a child can differ in sophistication across several domains ", "During the s and s cognitive developmentalists were influenced by neo nativist and evolutionary psychology ideas ", "These ideas de emphasized domain general theories and emphasized domain specificity or modularity of mind ", " Modularity implies that different cognitive faculties may be largely independent of one another and thus develop according to quite different timetables which are influenced by real world experiences ", " In this vein some cognitive developmentalists argued that rather than being domain general learners children come equipped with domain specific theories sometimes referred to as core knowledge which allows them to break into learning within that domain ", "For example even young infants appear to be sensitive to some predictable regularities in the movement and interactions of objects for example an object cannot pass through another object or in human behavior for example a hand repeatedly reaching for an object has that object not just a particular path of motion as it becomes the building block of which more elaborate knowledge is constructed ", "Piaget s theory has been said to undervalue the influence that culture has on cognitive development ", "Piaget demonstrates that a child goes through several stages of cognitive development and come to conclusions on their own however a child s sociocultural environment plays an important part in their cognitive development ", "Social interaction teaches the child about the world and helps them develop through the cognitive stages which Piaget neglected to consider ", " More recent work from a newer dynamic systems approach has strongly challenged some of the basic presumptions of the core knowledge school that Piaget suggested ", "Dynamic systems approaches harken to modern neuroscientific research that was not available to Piaget when he was constructing his theory ", " This brought new light into research in psychology in which new techniques such as brain imaging provided new understanding to cognitive development ", " One important finding is that domain specific knowledge is constructed as children develop and integrate knowledge ", "This enables the domain to improve the accuracy of the knowledge as well as organization of memories ", " However this suggests more of a smooth integration of learning and development than either Piaget or his neo nativist critics had envisioned ", "Additionally some psychologists such as Lev Vygotsky and Jerome Bruner thought differently from Piaget suggesting that language was more important for cognition development than Piaget implied ", " In recent years several theorists attempted to address concerns with Piaget s theory by developing new theories and models that can accommodate evidence which violates Piagetian predictions and postulates "]},

law in the Hebrew Bible it was widely practised in the late Second Temple period and particularly well documented in the period following the destruction of the temple into the rd th and th centuries

language as and ", " In doing so it transformed meaning gaining negative connotations with the magos being regarded as a charlatan whose ritual practices were fraudulent strange unconventional and dangerous ", " As noted by Davies for the ancient Greeks and subsequently for the ancient Romans magic was not distinct from religion but rather an unwelcome improper expression of it the religion of the other ", " The historian Richard Gordon suggested that for the ancient Greeks being accused of practicing magic was a form of insult ", " This change in meaning was influenced by the military conflicts that the Greek city states were then engaged in against the Persian Empire ", " In this context the term makes appearances in such surviving text as Sophocles Oedipus Rex Hippocrates De morbo sacro and Gorgias Encomium of Helen ", " In Sophocles play for example the character Oedipus derogatorily refers to the seer Tiresius as a magos in this context meaning something akin to quack or charlatan reflecting how this epithet was no longer reserved only for Persians ", " In the first century BCE the Greek concept of the magos was adopted into Latin and used by a number of ancient Roman writers as magus and magia ", " The earliest known Latin use of the term was in Virgil s Eclogue written around BCE which makes reference to magicis sacris magic rites ", " The Romans already had other terms for the negative use of supernatural powers such as veneficus and saga ", " The Roman use of the term was similar to that of the Greeks but placed greater emphasis on the judicial application of it ", " Within the Roman Empire laws would be introduced criminalising things regarded as magic ", " In ancient Roman society magic was associated with societies to the east of the empire the first century CE writer Pliny the Elder for instance claimed that magic had been created by the Iranian philosopher Zoroaster and that it had then been brought west into Greece by the magician Osthanes who accompanied the military campaigns of the Persian King Xerxes ", " Ancient Greek scholarship of the th century almost certainly influenced by Christianising preconceptions of the meanings of magic and religion and the wish to establish Greek culture as the foundation of Western rationality developed a theory of ancient Greek magic as primitive and insignificant and thereby essentially separate from Homeric communal polis religion ", "Since the last decade of the century however recognising the ubiquity and respectability of acts such as katadesmoi binding spells described as magic by modern and ancient observers alike scholars have been compelled to abandon this viewpoint ", " The Greek word mageuo practice magic itself derives from the word Magos originally simply the Greek name for a Persian tribe known for practicing religion ", " Non civic mystery cults have been similarly re evaluated the choices which lay outside the range of cults did not just add

the Greek classical period but private curses remained common throughout antiquity ", " They were distinguished as magical by their individualistic instrumental and sinister qualities ", " These qualities and their perceived deviation from inherently mutable cultural constructs of normality most clearly delineate ancient magic from the religious rituals of which they form a part ", " A large number of magical papyri in Greek Coptic and Demotic have been recovered and translated ", " They contain early instances of The practice of magic was banned in the late Roman world and the Codex Theodosianus AD states If any wizard therefore or person imbued with magical contamination who is called by custom of the people a magician should be apprehended in my retinue or in that of the Caesar he shall not escape punishment and torture by the protection of his rank Magic practices such as divination interpretation of omens sorcery and use of charms had been specifically forbidden in Mosaic Law and condemned in Biblical histories of the kings ", " Many of these practices were spoken against in the New Testament as well ", " Some commentators say that in the first century CE early Christian authors absorbed the Greco Roman concept of magic and incorporated it into their developing Christian theology and that these Christians retained the already implied Greco Roman negative stereotypes of the term and extented them by incorporating conceptual patterns borrowed from Jewish thought in particular the opposition of magic and miracle ", " Some early Christian authors followed the Greek Roman thinking by ascribing the origin of magic to the human realm mainly to Zoroaster and Osthanes ", "The Christian view was that magic was a product of the Babylonians Persians or Egyptians ", " The Christians shared with earlier classical culture the idea that magic was something distinct from proper religion although drew their distinction between the two in different ways ", " For early Christian writers like Augustine of Hippo magic did not merely constitute fraudulent and unsanctioned ritual practices but was the very opposite of religion because it relied upon cooperation from demons the henchmen of Satan ", " In this Christian ideas of magic were closely linked to the Christian category of paganism and both magic and paganism were regarded as belonging under the broader category of superstitio superstition another term borrowed from pre Christian Roman culture ", " This Christian emphasis on the inherent immorality and wrongness of magic as something conflicting with good religion was far starker than the approach in the other large monotheistic religions of the period Judaism and Islam ", " For instance while Christians regarded demons as inherently evil the jinn comparable entities in Islamic mythology were perceived as more ambivalent figures by Muslims ", " The model of the magician in Christian thought was provided by Simon Magus Simon the Magician a figure who opposed Saint Peter in both the Acts of the Apostles and the apocryphal yet influential Acts of Peter ", " The historian Michael D Bailey stated that in medieval Europe magic was a relatively broad and encompassing category ", " Christian theologians believed that there were multiple different forms of magic the majority of which were types of divination for instance Isidore of Seville produced a catalogue of things he regarded as magic in which he listed divination by the four elements i e ", "geomancy hydromancy aeromancy and pyromancy as well as by observation of natural phenomena e g ", "the flight of birds and astrology ", "He also mentioned enchantment and ligatures the medical use of magical objects bound to the patient as being magical ", " Medieval Europe also saw magic come to be associated with the Old Testament figure of Solomon various grimoires or books outlining magical practices were written that claimed to have been written by Solomon most notably the Key of Solomon ", " In early medieval Europe magia was a term of condemnation ", " In medieval Europe Christians often suspected Muslims and Jews of engaging in magical practices in certain cases these perceived magical rites including the alleged Jewish sacrifice of Christian children resulted in Christians massacring these religious minorities ", " Christian groups often also accused other rival Christian groups which they regarded as heretical of engaging in magical activities ", " Medieval Europe also saw the term maleficium applied to forms of magic that were conducted with the intention of causing harm ", " The later Middle Ages saw words for these practitioners of harmful magical acts appear in various European languages sorci re in French Hexe in German strega in Italian and bruja in Spanish ", " The English term for malevolent practitioners of magic witch derived from the earlier Old English term wicce ", " Ars Magica or magic is a major component and supporting contribution to the belief and practice of spiritual and in many cases physical healing throughout the Middle Ages ", "Emanating from many modern interpretations lies a trail of misconceptions about magic one of the largest revolving around wickedness or the existence of nefarious beings who practice it ", "These misinterpretations stem from numerous acts or rituals that have been performed throughout antiquity and due to their exoticism from the commoner s perspective the rituals invoked uneasiness and an even stronger sense of dismissal ", " In the Medieval Jewish view the separation of the mystical and magical elements of Kabbalah dividing it into speculative theological Kabbalah Kabbalah Iyyunit with its meditative traditions and theurgic practical Kabbalah Kabbalah Ma asit had occurred by the beginning of the th century ", " One societal force in the Middle Ages more powerful than the singular commoner the Christian Church rejected magic as a whole because it was viewed as a means of tampering with the natural world in a supernatural manner associated with the biblical verses of Deuteronomy ", "Despite the many negative connotations which surround the term magic there exist many elements that are seen in a divine or holy light ", " Diversified instruments or rituals used in medieval magic include but are not limited to various amulets talismans potions as well as specific chants dances and prayers ", "Along with these rituals are the adversely imbued notions of demonic participation which influence of them ", "The idea that magic was devised taught and worked by demons would have seemed reasonable to anyone who read the Greek magical papyri or the Sefer ha Razim and found that healing magic appeared alongside rituals for killing people gaining wealth or personal advantage and coercing women into sexual submission ", " Archaeology is contributing to a fuller understanding of ritual practices performed in the home on the body and in monastic and church settings ", " The Islamic reaction towards magic did not condemn magic in general and distinguished between magic which can heal sickness and possession and sorcery ", "The former is therefore a special gift from God while the latter is achieved through help of Jinn and devils ", "Ibn al Nadim held that exorcists gain their power by their obedience to God while sorcerers please the devils by acts of disobedience and sacrifices and they in return do him a favor ", " According to Ibn Arabi Al ajj j ibn Yusuf al Shubarbuli was able to walk on water due to his piety ", " According to the Quran magic was also taught to humans by devils and the fallen angels Harut and Marut ", " During the early modern period the concept of magic underwent a more positive reassessment through the development of the concept of magia naturalis natural magic ", " This was a term introduced and developed by two Italian humanists Marsilio Ficino and Giovanni Pico della Mirandola ", " For them magia was viewed as an elemental force pervading many natural processes and thus was fundamentally distinct from the mainstream Christian idea of demonic magic ", " Their ideas influenced an array of later philosophers and writers among them Paracelsus Giordano Bruno Johannes Reuchlin and Johannes Trithemius ", " According to the historian Richard Kieckhefer the concept of magia naturalis took firm hold in European culture during the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries attracting the interest of natural philosophers of various theoretical orientations including Aristotelians Neoplatonists and Hermeticists ", " Adherents of this position argued that magia could appear in both good and bad forms in the French librarian Gabriel Naud wrote his Apology for all the Wise Men Falsely Suspected of Magic in which he distinguished Mosoaicall Magick which he claimed came from God and included prophecies miracles and speaking in tongues from geotick magic caused by demons ", " While the proponents of magia naturalis insisted that this did not rely on the actions of demons critics disagreed arguing that the demons had simply deceived these magicians ", " By the seventeenth century the concept of magia naturalis had moved in increasingly naturalistic directions with the distinctions between it and science becoming blurred ", " The validity of magia naturalis as a concept for understanding the universe then came under increasing criticism during the Age of Enlightenment in the eighteenth century ", " Despite the attempt to reclaim the term magia for use in a positive sense it did not supplant traditional attitudes toward magic in the West which remained largely negative ", " At the same time as magia naturalis was attracting interest and was largely tolerated Europe saw an active persecution of accused witches believed to be guilty of maleficia ", " Reflecting the term s continued negative associations Protestants often sought to denigrate Roman Catholic sacramental and devotional practices as being magical rather than religious ", " Many Roman Catholics were concerned by this allegation and for several centuries various Roman Catholic writers devoted attention to arguing that their practices were religious rather than magical ", " At the same time Protestants often used the accusation of magic against other Protestant groups which they were in contest with ", " In this way the concept of magic was used to prescribe what was appropriate as religious belief and practice ", " Similar claims were also being made in the Islamic world during this period ", "The Arabian cleric Muhammad ibn Abd al Wahhab founder of Wahhabism for instance condemned a range of customs and practices such as divination and the veneration of spirits as sihr which he in turn claimed was a form of shirk the sin of idolatry ", " Renaissance humanism saw a resurgence in hermeticism and Neo Platonic varieties of ceremonial magic ", "The Renaissance on the other hand saw the rise of science in such forms as the dethronement of the Ptolemaic theory of the universe the distinction of astronomy from astrology and of chemistry from alchemy ", " page

the Early Modern witch craze further reinforced by the turmoil of the Protestant Reformation especially in Germany England and Scotland ", " page needed In Hasidism the displacement of practical Kabbalah using directly magical means by conceptual and meditative trends gained much further emphasis while simultaneously instituting meditative theurgy for material blessings at the heart of its social mysticism ", " Hasidism internalised Kabbalah through the psychology of deveikut cleaving to God and cleaving to the Tzadik Hasidic Rebbe ", "In Hasidic doctrine the tzaddik channels Divine spiritual and physical bounty to his followers by altering the Will of God uncovering a deeper concealed Will through his own deveikut and self nullification ", "Dov Ber of Mezeritch is concerned to distinguish this theory of the Tzadik s will altering and deciding the Divine Will from directly magical process ", " In the sixteenth century European societies began to conquer and colonise other continents around the world and as they did so they applied European concepts of magic and witchcraft to practices found among the peoples whom they encountered ", " Usually these European colonialists regarded the natives as primitives and savages whose belief systems were diabolical and needed to be eradicated and replaced by Christianity ", " Because Europeans typically viewed these non European peoples as being morally and intellectually inferior to themselves it was expected that such societies would be more prone to practicing magic ", " Women who practiced traditional rites were labelled as witches by the Europeans ", " In various cases these imported European concepts and terms underwent new transformations as they merged with indigenous concepts ", " In West Africa for instance Portuguese travellers introduced their term and concept of the feiti aria often translated as sorcery and the feiti o spell to the native population where it was transformed into the concept of the fetish ", "When later Europeans encountered these West African societies they wrongly believed that the fetiche was an indigenous African term rather than the result of earlier inter continental encounters ", " Sometimes colonised populations themselves adopted these European concepts for their own purposes ", "In the early nineteenth century the newly independent Haitian government of Jean Jacques Dessalines began to suppress the practice of Vodou and in Haitian law codes categorised all Vodou practices as sortil ge sorcery witchcraft suggesting that it was all conducted with harmful intent whereas among Vodou practitioners the performance of harmful rites was already given a separate and distinct category known as maji ", " Writers on occult or magical topics during this period include Michael Sendivogius Tommaso Campanella Jakob B hme Jan Baptist van Helmont Franz Kessler Adrian von Mynsicht Sir Kenelm Digby Johann Friedrich Schweitzer and Isaac Newton see Isaac Newton s occult studies ", "By the nineteenth century European intellectuals no longer saw the practice of magic through the framework of sin and instead regarded magical practices and beliefs as an aberrational mode of thought antithetical to the dominant cultural logic a sign of psychological impairment and marker of racial or cultural inferiority ", " As educated elites in Western societies increasingly rejected the efficacy of magical practices legal systems ceased to threaten practitioners of magical activities with punishment for the crimes of diabolism and witchcraft and instead threatened them with the accusation that they were defrauding people through promising to provide things which they could not ", " This spread of European colonial power across the world influenced how academics would come to frame the concept of magic ", " In the nineteenth century several scholars adopted the traditional negative concept of magic ", " That they chose to do so was not inevitable for they could have followed the example adopted by prominent esotericists active at the time like Helena Blavatsky who had chosen to use the term and concept of magic in a positive sense ", " Various writers also used the concept of magic to criticise religion by arguing that the latter still displayed many of the negative traits of the former ", "An example of this was the American journalist H L Mencken in his polemical work Treatise on the Gods he sought to critique religion by comparing it to magic arguing that the division between the two was misplaced ", " The concept of magic was also adopted by theorists in the new field of psychology where it was often used synonymously with superstition although the latter term proved more common in early psychological texts ", " In the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries folklorists examined rural communities across Europe in search of magical practices which at the time they typically understood as survivals of ancient belief systems ", " It was only in the s that anthropologists like Jeanne Favret Saada also began looking in depth at magic in European contexts having previously focused on examining magic in non Western contexts ", " In the twentieth century magic also proved a topic of interest to the Surrealists an artistic movement based largely in Europe the Surrealism Andr Breton for instance published L Art magique in discussing what he regarded as the links between magic and art ", " The scholarly application of magic as a sui generis category that can be applied to any socio cultural context was linked with the promotion of modernity to both Western and non Western audiences ", " The term magic has become pervasive in the popular imagination and idiom ", " In contemporary contexts the word magic is sometimes used to describe a type of excitement of wonder or sudden delight and in such a context can be a term of high praise ", " Despite its historical contrast against science scientists have also adopted the term in application to various concepts such as magic acid magic bullets and magic angles ", " Modern Western magic has challenged widely held preconceptions about contemporary religion and spirituality ", " The polemical discourses about magic influenced the self understanding of modern magicians several whom such as Aleister Crowley and Julius Evola were well versed in academic literature on the subject ", " According to scholar of religion Henrik Bogdan arguably the best known emic definition of the term magic was provided by Crowley ", " Crowley who favoured the spelling magick over magic to distinguish it from stage illusionism was of the view that Magick is the Science and Art of causing Change to occur in conformity with Will ", " Crowley s definition influenced that of subsequent magicians ", " Dion Fortune of the Fraternity of the Inner Light for instance stated that Magic is the art of changing consciousness according to Will ", " Gerald Gardner the founder of Gardnerian Wicca stated that magic was attempting to cause the physically unusual while Anton LaVey the founder of LaVeyan Satanism described magic as the change in situations or events in accordance with one s will which would using normally acceptable methods be unchangeable ", " The chaos magic movement emerged during the late th century as an attempt to strip away the symbolic ritualistic theological or otherwise ornamental aspects of other occult traditions and distill magic down to a set of basic techniques ", " These modern Western concepts of magic rely on a belief in correspondences connected to an unknown occult force that permeates the universe ", " As noted by Hanegraaff this operated according to a new meaning of magic which could not possibly have existed in earlier periods precisely because it is elaborated in reaction to the disenchantment of the world ", " For many and perhaps most modern Western magicians the goal of magic is deemed to be personal spiritual development ", " The perception of magic as a form of self development is central to the way that magical practices have been adopted into forms of modern Paganism and the New Age phenomenon ", " One significant development within modern Western magical practices has been sex magic ", " This was a practice promoted in the writings of Paschal Beverly Randolph and subsequently exerted a strong interest on occultist magicians like Crowley and Theodor Reuss ", " The adoption of the term magic by modern occultists can in some instances be a deliberate attempt to champion those areas of Western society which have traditionally been marginalised as a means of subverting dominant systems of power ", " The influential American Wiccan and author Starhawk for instance stated that Magic is another word that makes people uneasy so I use it deliberately because the words we are comfortable with the words that sound acceptable rational scientific and intellectually correct are comfortable precisely because they are the language of estrangement ", " In the present day among some countercultural subgroups the label is considered cool Sorcery is a legal concept in Papua New Guinea law which differentiates between legal good magic such as healing and fertility and illegal black magic held responsible for unexplained deaths ", " According to anthropologist Edward Evan Evans Pritchard magic formed a rational framework of beliefs and knowledge in some cultures like the Azande people of Africa ", " The historian Owen Davies stated that the word magic was beyond simple definition and had a range of meanings ", " Similarly the historian Michael D Bailey characterised magic as a deeply contested category and a very fraught label as a category he noted it was profoundly unstable given that definitions of the term have varied dramatically across time and between cultures ", " Scholars have engaged in extensive debates as to how to define magic with such debates resulting in intense dispute ", " Throughout such debates the scholarly community has failed to agree on a definition of magic in a similar manner to how they have failed to agree on a definition of religion ", " According with scholar of religion Michael Stausberg the phenomenon of people applying the concept of magic to refer to themselves and their own practices and beliefs goes as far back as late antiquity ", "However even among those throughout history who have described themselves as magicians there has been no common ground of what magic is ", " In Africa the word magic might simply be understood as denoting management of forces which as an activity is not weighted morally and is accordingly a neutral activity from the start of a magical practice but by the will of the magician is thought to become and to have an outcome which represents either good or bad evil ", " Ancient African culture was in the habit customarily of always discerning difference between magic and a group of other things which are not magic these things were medicine divination witchcraft and sorcery ", " Opinion differs on how religion and magic are related to each other with respect development or to which developed from which some think they developed together from a shared origin some think religion developed from magic and some magic from religion ", " Anthropological and sociological theories of magic generally serve to sharply demarcate certain practices from other otherwise similar practices in a given society ", " According to Bailey In many cultures and across various historical periods categories of magic often define and maintain the limits of socially and culturally acceptable actions in respect to numinous or occult entities or forces ", "Even more basically they serve to delineate arenas of appropriate belief ", " In this he noted that drawing these distinctions is an exercise in power ", " This tendency has had repercussions for the study of magic with academics self censoring their research because of the effects on their careers ", " Randall Styers noted that attempting to define magic represents an act of demarcation by which it is juxtaposed against other social practices and modes of knowledge such as religion and science ", " The historian Karen Louise Jolly described magic as a category of exclusion used to define an unacceptable way of thinking as either the opposite of religion or of science ", " Modern scholarship has produced various definitions and theories of magic ", " According to Bailey these have typically framed magic in relation to or morefrequently in distinction from religion and science ", " Since the emergence of the study of religion and the social sciences magic has been a central theme in the theoretical literature produced by scholars operating in these academic disciplines ", " Magic is one of the most heavily theorized concepts in the study of religion and also played a key role in early theorising within anthropology ", " Styers believed that it held such a strong appeal for social theorists because it provides such a rich site for articulating and contesting the nature and boundaries of modernity ", " Scholars have commonly used it as a foil for the concept of religion regarding magic as the illegitimate and effeminized sibling of religion ", " Alternately others have used it as a middle ground category located between religion and science ", " The context in which scholars framed their discussions of magic was informed by the spread of European colonial power across the world in the modern period ", " These repeated attempts to define magic resonated with broader social concerns and the pliability of the concept has allowed it to be readily adaptable as a polemical and ideological tool ", " The links that intellectuals made between magic and those they characterized as primitives helped to legitimise European and Euro American imperialism and colonialism as these Western colonialists expressed the view that those who believed in and practiced magic were unfit to govern themselves and should be governed by those who rather than believing in magic believed in science and or Christian religion ", " In Bailey s words the association of certain peoples whether non Europeans or poor rural Europeans with magic served to distance and differentiate them from those who ruled over them and in large part to justify that rule ", " Many different definitions of magic have been offered by scholars although according to Hanegraaff these can be understood as variations of a small number of heavily influential theories ", " The intellectualist approach to defining magic is associated with two prominent British anthropologists Edward Tylor and James G ", "Frazer ", " This approach viewed magic as the theoretical opposite of science and came to preoccupy much anthropological thought on the subject ", " This approach was situated within the evolutionary models which underpinned thinking in the social sciences during the early th century ", " The first social scientist to present magic as something that predated religion in an evolutionary development was Herbert Spencer in his A System of Synthetic Philosophy he used the term magic in reference to sympathetic magic ", " Spencer regarded both magic and religion as being rooted in false speculation about the nature of objects and their relationship to other things ", " Tylor s understanding of magic was linked to his concept of animism ", " In his book Primitive Culture Tylor characterized magic as beliefs based on the error of mistaking ideal analogy for real analogy ", " In Tylor s view primitive man having come to associate in thought those things which he found by experience to be connected in fact proceeded erroneously to invert this action and to conclude that association in thought must involve similar connection in reality ", "He thus attempted to discover to foretell and to cause events by means of processes which we can now see to have only an ideal significance ", " Tylor was dismissive of magic describing it as one of the most pernicious delusions that ever vexed mankind ", " Tylor s views proved highly influential and helped to establish magic as a major topic of anthropological research ", " Tylor s ideas were adopted and simplified by James Frazer ", " He used the term magic to mean sympathetic magic describing it as a practice relying on the magician s belief that things act on each other at a distance through a secret sympathy something which he described as an invisible ether ", " He further divided this magic into two forms the homeopathic imitative mimetic and the contagious ", " The former was the idea that like produces like or that the similarity between two objects could result in one influencing the other ", "The latter was based on the idea that contact between two objects allowed the two to continue to influence one another at a distance ", " Like Taylor Frazer viewed magic negatively describing it as the bastard sister of science arising from one great disastrous fallacy ", " Where Frazer differed from Tylor was in characterizing a belief in magic as a major stage in humanity s cultural development describing it as part of a tripartite division in which magic came first religion came second and eventually science came third ", " For Frazer all early societies started as believers in magic with some of them moving away from this and into religion ", " He believed that both magic and religion involved a belief in spirits but that they differed in the way that they responded to these spirits ", "For Frazer magic constrains or coerces these spirits while religion focuses on conciliating or propitiating them ", " He acknowledged that their common ground resulted in a cross over of magical and religious elements in various instances for instance he claimed that the sacred marriage was a fertility ritual which combined elements from both world views ", " Some scholars retained the evolutionary framework used by Frazer but changed the order of its stages the German ethnologist Wilhelm Schmidt argued that religion by which he meant monotheism was the first stage of human belief which later degenerated into both magic and polytheism ", " Others rejected the evolutionary framework entirely ", "Frazer s notion that magic had given way to religion as part of an evolutionary framework was later deconstructed by the folklorist and anthropologist Andrew Lang in his essay Magic and Religion Lang did so by highlighting how Frazer s framework relied upon misrepresenting ethnographic accounts of beliefs and practiced among indigenous Australians to fit his concept of magic ", " The functionalist approach to defining magic is associated with the French sociologists Marcel Mauss and Emile Durkheim ", " In this approach magic is understood as being the theoretical opposite of religion ", " Mauss set forth his conception of magic in a essay A General Theory of Magic ", " Mauss used the term magic in reference to any rite that is not part of an organized cult a rite that is private secret mysterious and ultimately tending towards one that is forbidden ", " Conversely he associated religion with organised cult ", " By saying that magic was inherently non social Mauss had been influenced by the traditional Christian understandings of the concept ", " Mauss deliberately rejected the intellectualist approach promoted by Frazer believing that it was inappropriate to restrict the term magic to sympathetic magic as Frazer had done ", " He expressed the view that there are not only magical rites which are not sympathetic but neither is sympathy a prerogative of magic since there are sympathetic practices in religion ", " Mauss ideas were adopted by Durkheim in his book The Elementary Forms of the Religious Life ", " Durkheim was of the view that both magic and religion pertained to sacred things that is to say things set apart and forbidden ", " Where he saw them as being different was in their social organisation ", "Durkheim used the term magic to describe things that were inherently anti social existing in contrast to what he referred to as a Church the religious beliefs shared by a social group in his words There is no Church of magic ", " Durkheim expressed the view that there is something inherently anti religious about the maneuvers of the magician and that a belief in magic does not result in binding together those who adhere to it nor in uniting them into a group leading a common life ", " Durkheim s definition encounters problems in situations such as the rites performed by Wiccans in which acts carried out communally have been regarded either by practitioners or observers as being magical ", " Scholars have criticized the idea that magic and religion can be differentiated into two distinct separate categories ", " The social anthropologist Alfred Radcliffe Brown suggested that a simple dichotomy between magic and religion was unhelpful and thus both should be subsumed under the broader category of ritual ", " Many later anthropologists followed his example ", " Nevertheless this distinction is still often made by scholars discussing this topic ", " The emotionalist approach to magic is associated with the English anthropologist Robert Ranulph Marett the Austrian Sigmund Freud and the Polish anthropologist Bronis aw Malinowski ", " Marett viewed magic as a response to stress ", " In a article he argued that magic was a cathartic or stimulating practice designed to relieve feelings of tension ", " As his thought developed he increasingly rejected the idea of a division between magic and religion and began to use the term magico religious to describe the early development of both ", " Malinowski similarly understood magic to Marett tackling the issue in a article ", " He rejected Frazer s evolutionary hypothesis that magic was followed by religion and then science as a series of distinct stages in societal development arguing that all three were present in each society ", " In his view both magic and religion arise and function in situations of emotional stress although whereas religion is primarily expressive magic is primarily practical ", " He therefore defined magic as a practical art consisting of acts which are only means to a definite end expected to follow later on ", " For Malinowski magical acts were to be carried out for a specific end whereas religious ones were ends in themselves ", " He for instance believed that fertility rituals were magical because they were carried out with the intention of meeting a specific need ", " As part of his functionalist approach Malinowski saw magic not as irrational but as something that served a useful function being sensible within the given social and environmental context ", " The term magic was used liberally by Freud ", " He also saw magic as emerging from human emotion but interpreted it very differently to Marett ", " Freud explains that the associated theory of magic merely explains the paths along which magic proceeds it does not explain its true essence namely the misunderstanding which leads it to replace the laws of nature by psychological ones ", " Freud emphasizes that what led primitive men to come up with magic is the power of wishes His wishes are accompanied by a motor impulse the will which is later destined to alter the whole face of the earth to satisfy his wishes ", "This motor impulse is at first employed to give a representation of the satisfying situation in such a way that it becomes possible to experience the satisfaction by means of what might be described as motor hallucinations ", "This kind of representation of a satisfied wish is quite comparable to children s play which succeeds their earlier purely sensory technique of satisfaction ", " As time goes on the psychological accent shifts from the motives for the magical act on to the measures by which it is carried out that is on to the act itself ", " It thus comes to appear as though it is the magical act itself which owing to its similarity with the desired result alone determines the occurrence of that result ", " In the early s the anthropologists Murray and Rosalie Wax put forward the argument that scholars should look at the magical worldview of a given society on its own terms rather than trying to rationalize it in terms of Western ideas about scientific knowledge ", " Their ideas were heavily criticised by other anthropologists who argued that they had set up a false dichotomy between non magical Western worldview and magical non Western worldviews ", " The concept of the magical worldview nevertheless gained widespread use in history folkloristics philosophy cultural theory and psychology ", " The notion of magical thinking has also been utilised by various psychologists ", " In the s the psychologist Jean Piaget used the concept as part of their argument that children were unable to clearly differentiate between the mental and the physical ", " According to this perspective children begin to abandon their magical thinking between the ages of six and nine ", " According to Stanley Tambiah magic science and religion all have their own quality of rationality and have been influenced by politics and ideology ", " As opposed to religion Tambiah suggests that mankind has a much more personal control over events ", "Science according to Tambiah is a system of behavior by which man acquires mastery of the environment ", " The magic religion science triangle developed in European society based on evolutionary ideas i e ", "that magic evolved into religion which in turn evolved into science ", " However using a Western analytical tool when discussing non Western cultures or pre modern forms of Western society raises problems as it may impose alien Western categories on them ", " While magic remains an emic insider term in the history of Western societies it remains an etic outsider term when applied to non Western societies and even within specific Western societies ", "For this reason academics like Michael D Bailey suggest abandon the term altogether as an academic category ", " During the twentieth century many scholars focusing on Asian and African societies rejected the term magic as well as related concepts like witchcraft in favour of the more precise terms and concepts that existed within these specific societies like Juju ", " A similar approach has been taken by many scholars studying pre modern societies in Europe such as Classical antiquity who find the modern concept of magic inappropriate and favour more specific terms originating within the framework of the ancient cultures which they are studying ", " Alternately this term implies that all categories of magic are ethnocentric and that such Western preconceptions are an unavoidable component of scholarly research ", " This century has seen a trend towards emic ethnographic studies by scholar practitioners that explicitly explore the emic etic divide ", " Many scholars have argued that the use of the term as an analytical tool within academic scholarship should be rejected altogether ", " The scholar of religion Jonathan Z Smith for example argued that it had no utility as an etic term that scholars should use ", " The historian of religion Wouter Hanegraaff agreed on the grounds that its use is founded in conceptions of Western superiority and has served as a scientific justification for converting non European peoples from benighted superstitions stating that the term magic is an important object of historical research but not intended for doing research ", " Bailey noted that as of the early st century few scholars sought grand definitions of magic but instead focused with careful attention to particular contexts examining what a term like magic meant to a given society this approach he noted call ed into question the legitimacy of magic as a universal category ", " The scholars of religion Berndt Christian Otto and Michael Stausberg suggested that it would be perfectly possible for scholars to talk about amulets curses healing procedures and other cultural practices often regarded as magical in Western culture without any recourse to the concept of magic itself ", " The idea that magic should be rejected as an analytic term developed in anthropology before moving into Classical studies and Biblical studies in the s ", " Since the s the term s usage among scholars of religion has declined ", " The historian Ronald Hutton notes the presence of four distinct meanings of the term witchcraft in the English language ", "Historically the term primarily referred to the practice of causing harm to others through supernatural or magical means ", "This remains according to Hutton the most widespread and frequent understanding of the term ", " Moreover Hutton also notes three other definitions in current usage to refer to anyone who conducts magical acts for benevolent or malevolent intent for practitioners of the modern Pagan religion of Wicca or as a symbol of women resisting male authority and asserting an independent female authority ", " Belief in witchcraft is often present within societies and groups whose cultural framework includes a magical world view ", " Those regarded as being magicians have often faced suspicion from other members of their society ", " This is particularly the case if these perceived magicians have been associated with social groups already considered morally suspect in a particular society such as foreigners women or the lower classes ", " In contrast to these negative associations many practitioners of activities that have been labelled magical have emphasised that their actions are benevolent and beneficial ", " This conflicted with the common Christian view that all activities categorised as being forms of magic were intrinsically bad regardless of the intent of the magician because all magical actions relied on the aid of demons ", " There could be conflicting attitudes regarding the practices of a magician in European history authorities often believed that cunning folk and traditional healers were harmful because their practices were regarded as magical and thus stemming from contact with demons whereas a local community might value and respect these individuals because their skills and services were deemed beneficial ", " In Western societies the practice of magic especially when harmful was usually associated with women ", " For instance during the witch trials of the early modern period around three quarters of those executed as witches were female to only a quarter who were men ", " That women were more likely to be accused and convicted of witchcraft in this period might have been because their position was more legally vulnerable with women having little or no legal standing that was independent of their male relatives ", " The conceptual link between women and magic in Western culture may be because many of the activities regarded as magical from rites to encourage fertility to potions to induce abortions were associated with the female sphere ", " It might also be connected to the fact that many cultures portrayed women as being inferior to men on an intellectual moral spiritual and physical level ", " Many of the practices which have been labelled magic can be performed by anyone ", " For instance some charms can be recited by individuals with no specialist knowledge nor any claim to having a specific power ", " Others require specialised training in order to perform them ", " Some of the individuals who performed magical acts on a more than occasional basis came to be identified as magicians or with related concepts like sorcerers sorceresses witches or cunning folk ", " Identities as a magician can stem from an individual s own claims about themselves or it can be a label placed upon them by others ", " In the latter case an individual could embrace such a label or they could reject it sometimes vehemently ", " Economic incentives can encourage individuals to identify as magicians ", " In the cases of various forms of traditional healer as well as the later stage magicians or illusionists the label of magician could become a job description ", " Others claim such an identity out of a genuinely held belief that they have specific unusual powers or talents ", " Different societies have different social regulations regarding who can take on such a role for instance it may be a question of familial heredity or there may be gender restrictions on who is allowed to engage in such practices ", " A variety of personal traits may be credited with giving magical power and frequently they are associated with an unusual birth into the world ", " For instance in Hungary it was believed that a t ltos would be born with teeth or an additional finger ", " In various parts of Europe it was believed that being born with a caul would associate the child with supernatural abilities ", " In some cases a ritual initiation is required before taking on a role as a specialist in such practices and in others it is expected that an individual will receive a mentorship from another specialist ", " Davies noted that it was possible to crudely divide magic specialists into religious and lay categories ", " He noted for instance that Roman Catholic priests with their rites of exorcism and access to holy water and blessed herbs could be conceived as being magical practitioners ", " Traditionally the most common method of identifying differentiating and establishing magical practitioners from common people is by initiation ", "By means of rites the magician s relationship to the supernatural and his entry into a closed professional class is established often through rituals that simulate death and rebirth into a new life ", " However Berger and Ezzy explain that since the rise of Neopaganism As there is no central bureaucracy or dogma to determine authenticity an individual s self determination as a Witch Wiccan Pagan or Neopagan is usually taken at face value ", " Ezzy argues that practitioners worldviews have been neglected in many sociological and anthropological studies and that this is because of a culturally narrow understanding of science that devalues magical beliefs ", " Mauss argues that the powers of both specialist and common magicians are determined by culturally accepted standards of the sources and the breadth of magic a magician cannot simply invent or claim new magic ", "In practice the magician is only as powerful as his peers believe him to be ", " Throughout recorded history magicians have often faced skepticism regarding their purported powers and abilities ", " For instance in sixteenth century England the writer Reginald Scot wrote The Discoverie of Witchcraft in which he argued that many of those accused of witchcraft or otherwise claiming magical capabilities were fooling people using illusionism ", " "]},

described by scholars as a religion and more specifically as both a new religious movement and as a magico religious doctrine ", " It has also been characterized as a form of esotericism and Modern Paganism ", " Although holding The Book of the Law which was composed in as its central text Thelema took shape as a complete system in the years after ", " In his autobiography Crowley claimed that his purpose in life had been to bring oriental wisdom to Europe and to restore paganism in a purer form although what he meant by paganism was unclear ", " Crowley also wrote in the th Book of Magick about a great pagan Umbral fleet ruled by Ottovius that would be handed down to the great Spartan ", "The esoteric nature of this was also unclear ", "Crowley s thought was not always cohesive and was influenced by a variety of sources ranging from eastern religious movements and practices like Hindu yoga and Buddhism scientific naturalism and various currents within Western esotericism among them ceremonial magic alchemy astrology Rosicrucianism Kabbalah and the Tarot ", " He was steeped in the esoteric teachings he had learned from the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn although pushed further with his own interpretations and strategies than the Golden Dawn had done ", " Crowley incorporated concepts and terminology from South Asian religious traditions like yoga and Tantra into his Thelemic system believing that there was a fundamental underlying resemblance between Western and Eastern spiritual systems ", " The historian Alex Owen noted that Crowley adhered to the modus operandi of the Decadent movement throughout his life ", " Crowley believed that the twentieth century marked humanity s entry to the Aeon of Horus a new era in which humans would take increasing control of their destiny ", "He believed that this Aeon follows on from the Aeon of Osiris in which paternalistic religions like Christianity Islam and Buddhism dominated the world and that this in turn had followed the Aeon of Isis which had been maternalistic and dominated by goddess worship ", " He believed that Thelema was the proper religion of the Aeon of Horus and also deemed himself to be the prophet of this new Aeon ", " Thelema revolves around the idea that human beings each have their own True Will that they should discover and pursue and that this exists in harmony with the Cosmic Will that pervades the universe ", " Crowley referred to this process of searching and discovery of one s True Will to be the Great Work or the attaining of the knowledge and conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel ", " His favoured method of doing so was through the performance of the Abramelin operation a ceremonial magic ritual obtained from a th century grimoire ", " The moral code of Do What Thou Wilt is believed by Thelemites to be the religion s ethical law although the historian of religion Marco Pasi noted that this was not anarchistic or libertarian in structure as Crowley saw individuals as part of a wider societal organism ", " Crowley believed in the objective existence of magic which he chose to spell Magick an older archaic spelling of the word ", " He provided various different definitions of this term over his career ", " In his book Magick in Theory and Practice Crowley defined Magick as the Science and Art of causing change to occur in conformity with Will ", " He also told his disciple Karl Germer that Magick is getting into communication with individuals who exist on a higher plane than ours ", "Mysticism is the raising of oneself to their level ", " Crowley saw Magick as a third way between religion and science giving The Equinox the subtitle of The Method of Science the Aim of Religion ", " Within that journal he expressed positive sentiments toward science and the scientific method and urged magicians to keep detailed records of their magical experiments The more scientific the record is the better ", " His understanding of magic was also influenced by the work of the anthropologist James Frazer in particular the view that magic was a precursor to science in a cultural evolutionary framework ", " Unlike Frazer however Crowley did not see magic as a survival from the past that required eradication but rather he believed that magic had to be adapted to suit the new age of science ", " In Crowley s alternative schema old systems of magic had to decline per Frazer s framework so that science and magic could synthesize into magick which would simultaneously accept the existence of the supernatural and an experimental method ", " Crowley deliberately adopted an exceptionally broad definition of magick that included almost all forms of technology as magick adopting an instrumentalist interpretation of magic science and technology ", " To Crowley the greatest aim of the magician was to merge with a higher power connected to the wellsprings of the universe but he did not trouble himself too much to define that power consistently sometimes it was God sometimes the One sometimes a goddess and sometimes one s own Holy Guardian Angel or higher self ", "In the last analysis he was content for the nature of divinity to remain a mystery ", "As a result he wrote at times like an atheist at times like a monotheist and at others like a polytheist ", "R Hutton Sexuality played an important role in Crowley s ideas about magick and his practice of it and has been described as being central to Thelema ", " He outlined three forms of sex magick the autoerotic homosexual and heterosexual and argued that such acts could be used to focus the magician s will onto a specific goal such as financial gain or personal creative success ", " For Crowley sex was treated as a sacrament with the consumption of sexual fluids interpreted as a Eucharist ", " This was often manifested as the Cakes of Light a biscuit containing either menstrual blood or a mixture of semen and vaginal fluids ", " The Gnostic Mass is the central religious ceremony within Thelema ", " Crowley s theological beliefs were not clear ", "The historian Ronald Hutton noted that some of Crowley s writings could be used to argue that he was an atheist while some support the idea that he was a polytheist and others would bolster the idea that he was a mystical monotheist ", " On the basis of the teachings in The Book of the Law Crowley described a pantheon of three deities taken from the ancient Egyptian pantheon Nuit Hadit and Ra Hoor Khuit ", " In he made the claim that all true deities were derived from this trinity ", " Jason Josephson Storm has argued that Crowley built on th century attempts to link early Christianity to pre Christian religions such as Frazer s Golden Bough to synthesize Christian theology and Neopaganism while remaining critical of institutional and traditional Christianity ", " Both during his life and after it Crowley has been widely described as a Satanist usually by detractors ", "Crowley stated he did not consider himself a Satanist nor did he worship Satan as he did not accept the Christian world view in which Satan was believed to exist ", " He nevertheless used Satanic imagery for instance by describing himself as the Beast and referring to the Whore of Babylon in his work while in later life he sent Antichristmas cards to his friends ", " In his writings Crowley occasionally identified Aiwass as Satan and designated him as Our Lord God the Devil at one occasion ", " The scholar of religion Gordan Djurdjevic stated that Crowley was emphatically not a Satanist if for no other reason than simply because he did not identify himself as such ", " Crowley nevertheless expressed strong anti Christian sentiment stating that he hated Christianity as Socialists hate soap an animosity probably stemming from his experiences among the Plymouth Brethren ", " He was nevertheless influenced by the King James Bible especially the Book of Revelation the impact of which can be seen in his writings ", " He was also accused of advocating human sacrifice largely because of a passage in Book in which he stated that A male child of perfect innocence and high intelligence is the most satisfactory victim and added that he had sacrificed about every year ", "This was a tongue in cheek reference to ejaculation something not realized by his critics ", " Crowley considered himself to be one of the outstanding figures of his time ", " The historian Ronald Hutton stated that in Crowley s youth he was a self indulgent and flamboyant young man who set about a deliberate flouting and provocation of social and religious norms while being shielded from an outraged public opinion by his inherited wealth ", " Hutton also described Crowley as having both an unappeasable desire to take control of any organisation that he belonged to and a tendency to quarrel savagely with those who challenged him ", " Crowley biographer Martin Booth asserted that Crowley was self confident brash eccentric egotistic highly intelligent arrogant witty wealthy and when it suited him cruel ", " Similarly Richard B Spence noted that Crowley was capable of immense physical and emotional cruelty ", " Biographer Lawrence Sutin noted that Crowley exhibited courage skill dauntless energy and remarkable focus of will while at the same time showing a blind arrogance petty fits of bile and contempt for the abilities of his fellow men ", " The Thelemite Lon Milo DuQuette noted that Crowley was by no means perfect and often alienated those who loved him dearest ", " Crowley enjoyed being outrageous and flouting conventional morality with John Symonds noting that he was in revolt against the moral and religious values of his time ", " Crowley s political thought was studied by academic Marco Pasi who noted that for Crowley socio political concerns were subordinate to metaphysical and spiritual ones ", " He was neither on the political left nor right but perhaps best categorized as a conservative revolutionary despite not being affiliated with the German based movement of the same name ", " Pasi described Crowley s fascination to the extreme ideologies of Nazism and Marxism Leninism which aimed to violently overturn society What Crowley liked about Nazism and communism or at least what made him curious about them was the anti Christian position and the revolutionary and socially subversive implications of these two movements ", "In their subversive powers he saw the possibility of an annihilation of old religious traditions and the creation of a void that Thelema subsequently would be able to fill ", " Crowley described democracy as an imbecile and nauseating cult of weakness and commented that The Book of the Law proclaimed that there is the master and there is the slave the noble and the serf the lone wolf and the herd ", " In this attitude he was influenced by the work of Friedrich Nietzsche and by Social Darwinism ", " Although he had contempt for most of the British aristocracy he regarded himself as an aristocrat and styled himself as Laird Boleskine once describing his ideology as aristocratic communism ", " Crowley was bisexual but exhibited a preference for women with his relationships with men being fewer and mostly in the early part of his life ", " In particular he had an attraction toward exotic women and claimed to have fallen in love on multiple occasions Kaczynski stated that when he loved he did so with his whole being but the passion was typically short lived ", " Even in later life Crowley was able to attract young bohemian women to be his lovers largely due to his charisma ", " He applied the term Scarlet Woman to various female lovers whom he believed played an important role in his magical work ", " During homosexual acts he usually played the passive role which Booth believed appealed to his masochistic side ", " An underlying theme in many of his writings is that spiritual enlightenment arises through transgressing socio sexual norms ", " Crowley advocated complete sexual freedom for both men and women ", " He argued that homosexual and bisexual people should not suppress their sexual orientation commenting that a person must not be ashamed or afraid of being homosexual if he happens to be so at heart he must not attempt to violate his own true nature because of public opinion or medieval morality or religious prejudice which would wish he were otherwise ", " On other issues he adopted a more conservative attitude he opposed abortion on moral grounds believing that no woman following her True Will would ever desire one ", " Biographer Lawrence Sutin stated that blatant bigotry is a persistent minor element in Crowley s writings ", " Sutin thought Crowley a spoiled scion of a wealthy Victorian family who embodied many of the worst John Bull racial and social prejudices of his upper class contemporaries noting that he embodied the contradiction that writhed within many Western intellectuals of the time deeply held racist viewpoints courtesy of society coupled with a fascination with people of colour ", " Crowley is said to have insulted his close Jewish friend Victor Benjamin Neuburg using antisemitic slurs and he had mixed opinions about Jewish people as a group ", " Although he praised their sublime poetry and stated that they exhibited imagination romance loyalty probity and humanity he also thought that centuries of persecution had led some Jewish people to exhibit avarice servility falseness cunning and the rest ", " He was also known to praise various ethnic and cultural groups for instance he thought that the Chinese people exhibited a spiritual superiority to the English and praised Muslims for exhibiting manliness straightforwardness subtlety and self respect ", " Both critics of Crowley and adherents of Thelema have accused Crowley of sexism ", " Booth described Crowley as exhibiting a general misogyny something the biographer believed arose from Crowley s bad relationship with his mother ", " Sutin noted that Crowley largely accepted the notion implicitly embodied in Victorian sexology of women as secondary social beings in terms of intellect and sensibility ", " The scholar of religion Manon Hedenborg White noted that some of Crowley s statements are undoubtedly misogynist by contemporary standards but characterized Crowley s attitude toward women as complex and multi faceted ", " Crowley s comments on women s role varied dramatically within his written work even that produced in similar periods ", " Crowley described women as moral inferiors who had to be treated with firmness kindness and justice while also arguing that Thelema was essential to women s emancipation ", " Biographers Richard B Spence and Tobias Churton have suggested that Crowley was a spy for the British secret services and that among other things he joined the Golden Dawn under their command to monitor the activities of Mathers who was known to be a Carlist ", " Spence suggested that the conflict between Mathers and the London lodge for the temple was part of an intelligence operation to undermine Mathers authority ", " Spence has suggested that the purpose of Crowley s trip to Mexico might have been to explore Mexican oil prospects for British intelligence ", " Spence has suggested that his trip to China was orchestrated as part of a British intelligence scheme to monitor the region s opium trade ", " Churton suggested that Crowley had travelled to Moscow on the orders of British intelligence to spy on revolutionary elements in the city ", " Spence and Sutin both claim that Crowley s pro German work in the United States was actually a cover for him being a double agent for Britain citing his hyperbolic articles in The Fatherland to make the German lobby appear ridiculous in the eyes of the American public ", " Spence also claims that Crowley encouraged the German Navy to destroy the Lusitania informing them that it would ensure the US stayed out of the war while in reality hoping that it would bring the US into the war on Britain s side ", " H e is today looked upon as a source of inspiration by many people in search of spiritual enlightenment and or instructions in magical practice ", "Thus while during his life his books hardly sold and his disciples were never very numerous nowadays all his important works are constantly in print and the people defining themselves as thelemites that is followers of Crowley s new religion number several thousands all over the world ", "Furthermore Crowley s influence over magically oriented new religious movements has in some cases been very deep and pervasive ", "It would be difficult to understand for instance some aspects of Anglo Saxon neo paganism and contemporary satanism without a solid knowledge of Crowley s doctrines and ideas ", "In other fields such as poetry alpinism and painting he may have been a minor figure but it is only fair to admit that in the limited context of occultism he has played and still plays a major role ", "Marco Pasi ", " Crowley has remained an influential figure both amongst occultists and in popular culture particularly that of Britain but also of other parts of the world ", "In a BBC poll placed Crowley seventy third in a list of the Greatest Britons ", " Richard Cavendish has written of him that In native talent penetrating intelligence and determination Aleister Crowley was the best equipped magician to emerge since the seventeenth century ", " The scholar of esotericism Egil Asprem described him as one of the most well known figures in modern occultism ", " The scholar of esotericism Wouter Hanegraaff asserted that Crowley was an extreme representation of the dark side of the occult adding that he was the most notorious occultist magician of the twentieth century ", " The philosopher John Moore who ", "opined that Crowley stood out as a Modern Master when compared with other prominent occult figures like George Gurdjieff P D Ouspensky Rudolf Steiner or Helena Blavatsky also describing him as a living embodiment of Oswald Spengler s Faustian Man ", " Biographer Tobias Churton considered Crowley a pioneer of consciousness research ", " Hutton noted that Crowley had an important place in the history of modern Western responses to Oriental spiritual traditions while Sutin thought that he had made distinctly original contributions to the study of yoga in the West ", " Thelema continued to develop and spread following Crowley s death ", "In the O T O ", "was reactivated in California under the leadership of Grady Louis McMurtry in its right to the title was unsuccessfully challenged in court by a rival group the Society Ordo Templi Orientis led by Brazilian Thelemite Marcelo Ramos Motta ", " Another American Thelemite is the filmmaker Kenneth Anger who had been influenced by Crowley s writings from a young age ", " In the United Kingdom Kenneth Grant propagated a tradition known as Typhonian Thelema through his organisation the Typhonian O T O later renamed the Typhonian Order ", " Also in Britain an occultist known as Amado Crowley claimed to be Crowley s son this has been refuted by academic investigation ", "Amado argued that Thelema was a false religion created by Crowley to hide his true esoteric teachings which Amado claimed to be propagating ", " Several Western esoteric traditions other than Thelema were also influenced by Crowley with Djurdjevic observing that Crowley s influence on twentieth century and contemporary esotericism has been enormous ", " Gerald Gardner founder of Gardnerian Wicca made use of much of Crowley s published material when composing the Gardnerian ritual liturgy and the Australian witch Rosaleen Norton was also heavily influenced by Crowley s ideas ", " More widely Crowley became a dominant figure in the modern Pagan community ", " L Ron Hubbard the American founder of Scientology was involved in Thelema in the early s with Jack Parsons and it has been argued that Crowley s ideas influenced some of Hubbard s work ", " The scholars of religion Asbj rn Dyrendel James R Lewis and Jesper Petersen noted that despite the fact that Crowley was not a Satanist he in many ways embodies the pre Satanist esoteric discourse on Satan and Satanism through his lifestyle and his philosophy with his image and ought becoming an important influence on the later development of religious Satanism ", " For instance two prominent figures in religious Satanism Anton LaVey and Michael Aquino were influenced by Crowley s work ", " Crowley also had a wider influence in British popular culture ", "After his time in Cefal which had brought him to public attention in Britain various literary Crowleys appeared characters in fiction based upon him ", " One of the earliest was the character of the poet Shelley Arabin in John Buchan s novel The Dancing Floor ", " In his novel The Devil Rides Out the writer Dennis Wheatley used Crowley as a partial basis for the character of Damien Morcata a portly bald defrocked priest who engages in black magic ", " The occultist Dion Fortune used Crowley as a basis for characters in her books The Secrets of Doctor Taverner and The Winged Bull ", " He was included as one of the figures on the cover art of The Beatles album Sgt ", "Pepper s Lonely Hearts Club Band and his motto of Do What Thou Wilt was inscribed on the vinyl of Led Zeppelin s album Led Zeppelin III ", " Led Zeppelin co founder Jimmy Page bought

Daisley wrote a song titled Mr Crowley ", " A prophetic quote about the coming of the New Aeon borrowed from Crowley s work Magick in Theory and Practice has been featured as the opening introduction

considerably more advanced than it had been during World War I and advances continued throughout the war with increases in speed armour and firepower ", " At the start of the war most commanders thought enemy tanks should be met by tanks with superior specifications ", " This idea was challenged by the poor performance of the relatively light early tank guns against armour and German doctrine of avoiding tank versus tank combat ", "This along with Germany s use of combined arms were among the key elements of their highly successful blitzkrieg tactics across Poland and France ", " Many means of destroying tanks including indirect artillery anti tank guns both towed and self propelled mines short ranged infantry antitank weapons and other tanks were used ", " Even with large scale mechanisation infantry remained the backbone of all forces and throughout the war most infantry were equipped similarly to World War I ", " The portable machine gun spread a notable example being the German MG and various submachine guns which were suited to close combat in urban and jungle settings ", " The assault rifle a late war development incorporating many features of the rifle and submachine gun became the standard post war infantry weapon for most armed forces ", " Most major belligerents attempted to solve the problems of complexity and security involved in using large

Kingdom by the Polish Cipher Bureau which had been decoding early versions of Enigma before the war ", " Another aspect of military intelligence was the use of deception which the Allies used to great effect such as in operations Mincemeat and Bodyguard ", " Other technological and engineering feats achieved during or as a result of the war include the world s first programmable computers Z

of American deaths but uniquely among Pacific War Marine battles the American total casualties dead and wounded exceeded those of the Japanese ", " Of the Japanese soldiers on Iwo Jima at the beginning of the battle only were taken prisoner some of whom were captured only because they had been knocked unconscious or otherwise disabled ", " f Most of the remainder were killed in action but it has been estimated that as many as continued to resist within the various cave systems for many days afterwards until they eventually succumbed to their injuries or surrendered weeks later ", " Despite the fighting and severe casualties on both sides the American victory was assured from the start ", "Overwhelming American superiority in numbers and arms as well as air supremacy coupled with the impossibility of Japanese retreat or reinforcement sparse food and supplies permitted no plausible circumstance in which the Japanese could have won the battle ", " The action was controversial with retired Chief of Naval Operations William V Pratt stating that the island was useless to the Army as a staging base and useless to the Navy as a fleet base ", " The Japanese continued to have early warning radar from Rota island which was never invaded and the captured air field was barely used ", " Experiences with previous Pacific island battles suggested that the island would be well defended and thus casualties would be significant ", "Joe Rosenthal s Associated Press photograph of the raising of the U S flag at the top of the m ft Mount Suribachi by five U S Marines and one Navy corpsman became a famous image of the battle and the American war effort in the Pacific ", " After the American capture of the Marshall Islands and the devastating air attacks against the Japanese fortress island of Truk Atoll in the Carolines in January the Japanese military leaders reevaluated their situation ", "All indications pointed to an American drive toward the Mariana Islands and the Carolines ", "To counter such an offensive the IJA and the Imperial Japanese Navy IJN established an inner line of defenses extending generally northward from the Carolines to the Marianas and then to Japan via the Volcano Islands and westward from the Marianas via the Carolines and the Palau Islands to the Philippines ", "In March the Japanese st Army commanded by General Hideyoshi Obata was activated to garrison this inner line ", " Note that a Japanese army was about the size of an American British Army or Canadian Army corps ", "The Japanese Army had many armies but the U S Army had

the Japanese who were afraid that the loss of those islands would facilitate American air raids against the Home Islands disrupt war manufacturing and severely damage civilian morale ", " page needed The final Japanese plans for the defense of the Volcano Islands were overshadowed by several factors In a postwar study Japanese staff officers described the strategy used in the defense of Iwo Jima in the following terms In the light of the above situation seeing that it was impossible to conduct our air sea and ground operations on Iwo Island Jima toward ultimate victory it was decided that to gain time necessary for the preparation of the Homeland defense our forces should rely solely upon the established defensive equipment in that area checking the enemy by delaying tactics ", "Even the suicidal attacks by small groups of our Army and Navy airplanes the surprise attacks by our submarines and the actions of parachute units although effective could be regarded only as a strategical ruse on our part ", "It was a most depressing thought that we had no available means left for the exploitation of the strategical opportunities which might from time to time occur in the course of these operations ", " At the end of the Battle of Leyte in the Philippines the Allies were left with a two month lull in their offensive operations before the planned invasion of Okinawa ", "Iwo Jima was considered strategically important since it provided an air base for Japanese fighter planes to intercept long range B Superfortress bombers ", "In addition it was used by the Japanese to stage nuisance air attacks on the Mariana Islands from November to January ", "The capture of Iwo Jima would eliminate those problems ", "The base would be available for P Mustang fighters to escort and

assigned to command the defense of Iwo Jima ", "Kuribayashi knew that Japan could not win the battle but he hoped to inflict massive casualties on the American forces so that the United States and its Australian and British allies would reconsider carrying out their invasion of the Japanese home islands ", "While drawing inspiration from the defense in the Battle of Peleliu Kuribayashi designed a defense that broke with Japanese military doctrine ", "Rather than establishing his defenses on the beach to face the landings directly he created strong mutually supporting defenses in depth by using static and heavy weapons such as heavy machine guns and artillery ", "Takeichi Nishi s armored tanks were to be used as camouflaged artillery positions ", "Because the tunnel linking the mountain to the main forces was never completed Kuribayashi organized the southern area of the island in and around Mount Suribachi as a semi independent sector with his main defensive zone built up in the north ", "The expected American naval and air bombardment further prompted the creation of an extensive system of tunnels that connected the prepared positions so that a pillbox that had been cleared could be reoccupied ", "This network of bunkers and pillboxes favored the defense ", "For instance the Nano Bunker Southern Area Islands Naval Air HQ which was east of Airfield Number had enough food water and ammunition for the Japanese to hold out for three months ", "The bunker was feet deep and had tunnels running in various directions ", "Approximately five hundred gallon drums filled with water

useless to the Army as a staging base and useless to the Navy as a fleet base one wonders if the same sort of airbase could not have been reached by acquiring other strategic localities at lower cost ", " The lessons learned on Iwo Jima served as guidelines for the following Battle of Okinawa and the planned invasion of the Japanese homeland ", "For example because of the casualties taken at Iwo Jima on the first day it was decided to make the preparatory bombardment the heaviest yet delivered on to a Pacific island ", " Also in the planning for a potential attack on the Japanese home islands it was taken into account that around a third of the troops committed to Iwo Jima and again at Okinawa had been killed or wounded ", " The justification for Iwo Jima s strategic importance to the United States war effort has been that it provided a landing and refueling site for long range fighter escorts ", "These escorts proved both impractical and unnecessary and only ten such missions were ever flown from Iwo Jima ", " By the time Iwo Jima had been captured the bombing campaign against Japan had switched from daylight precision bombing to nighttime incendiary attacks so fighter escorts were of limited utility ", " Japanese fighter aircraft based on Iwo Jima sometimes attacked AAF planes which were vulnerable on their way to Japan because they were heavily laden with bombs and fuel ", "However although some Japanese interceptors were based on Iwo Jima their impact on the American bombing effort was marginal in the three months before the invasion only B s were lost as a result ", " The Superfortresses found it unnecessary to make any major detour around the island ", " Capturing the island neutralized Japanese air attacks based from it on the Marianas but they were too small to ever launch significant attacks ", " The Japanese on Iwo Jima had radar and were thus able to notify their comrades at home of incoming B Superfortresses flying from the Mariana Islands ", "However the capture of Iwo Jima did not affect the Japanese early warning radar system which continued to receive information on incoming B s from the island of Rota which was never invaded ", " As

the airplane landed on the Allied controlled section of the island South Field without incident and was serviced refueled and departed ", "In all B landings on Iwo Jima were recorded during the war ", " Author J Robert Moskin records that fighter escorts and strike sorties were flown from Iwo Jima against Japan ", " A more recent Air Force study found the contribution of VII Fighter Command superfluous ", "Another rationale for capturing the island was to serve as a base for shorter range B Liberator bombers against Japan but no significant B bombing campaign ever materialized ", " Some downed B crewmen were saved by air sea rescue aircraft and vessels operating from the island but Iwo Jima was only one of many islands that could have been used for such a purpose ", "As for the importance of the island as a landing and refueling site for bombers Marine Captain Robert Burrell then a history instructor at the United States Naval Academy suggested that only a small proportion of the landings were for genuine emergencies the great majority possibly being for minor technical checkups training or refueling ", "According to Burrell This justification became prominent only after the Marines seized the island and incurred high casualties ", "The tragic cost of Operation Detachment pressured veterans journalists and commanders to fixate on the most visible rationalization for the battle ", "The sight of the enormous costly and technologically sophisticated B landing on the island s small airfield most clearly linked Iwo Jima to the strategic bombing campaign ", "As the myths about the flag raisings on Mount Suribachi reached legendary proportions so did the emergency landing theory in order to justify the need to raise that flag ", " The emergency landing thesis counts every B landing on Iwo Jima as an emergency and asserts that capturing the island saved the lives of the nearly crewmen of all planes B crewmen were killed in combat during the whole war in all theaters ", "However of the nearly B s which landed from May July more than were for routine refueling ", "Several hundred landings were made for training purposes and most of the remainder were for relatively minor engine maintenance ", "During June which saw the largest number of landings none of the more than B s that landed on the island did so due to combat damage ", "Of the aircraft that would have been lost without being able to land air sea rescue figures indicate that of crewmen who ditched at sea survived so even if Iwo Jima was never taken the estimate of the supposedly potential dead crewmen from airplanes crashing into the ocean should be dwindled down to ", " In publishing The Ghosts of Iwo Jima Texas A M University Press said that the very losses formed the basis for a

level surpassing joules ", "From the Middle Ages through most of the modern era artillery pieces on land were moved by horse drawn gun carriages ", "In the contemporary era artillery pieces and their crew relied on wheeled or tracked vehicles as transportation ", "These land versions of artillery were dwarfed by railway guns the largest of these large calibre guns ever conceived Project Babylon of the Supergun affair was theoretically capable of putting a satellite into orbit ", "Artillery used by naval forces has also changed significantly with missiles generally replacing guns in surface warfare ", "Over the course of military history projectiles were manufactured from a wide variety of materials into a wide variety of shapes using many different methods in which to target structural defensive works and inflict enemy casualties ", "The engineering applications for ordnance delivery have likewise changed significantly over time encompassing some of the most complex and advanced technologies in use today ", "In some armies the weapon of artillery is the projectile not the equipment that fires it ", "The process of delivering fire onto the target is called gunnery ", "The actions involved in operating an artillery piece are collectively called serving the gun by the detachment or gun crew constituting either direct or indirect artillery fire ", "The manner in which gunnery crews or formations are employed is called artillery support ", "At different periods in history this may refer to weapons designed to be fired from ground sea and even air based weapons platforms ", "Some armed forces use the term gunners for the soldiers and sailors with the primary function of using artillery ", "The gunners and their guns are usually grouped in teams called either crews or detachments ", "Several such crews and teams with other functions are combined into a unit of artillery usually called a battery although sometimes called a company ", "In gun detachments each role is numbered starting with the Detachment Commander and the highest number being the Coverer the second in command ", " Gunner is also the lowest rank and junior non commissioned officers are Bombardiers in some artillery arms ", "Batteries are roughly equivalent to a company in the infantry and are combined into larger military organizations for administrative and operational purposes either battalions or regiments depending on the army ", "These may be grouped into brigades the Russian army also groups some brigades into artillery divisions and the People s Liberation Army has artillery corps ", "The term artillery also designates a combat arm of most military services when used organizationally to describe units and formations of the national armed forces that operate the weapons ", "During military operations field artillery has the role of providing support to other arms in combat or of attacking targets particularly in depth ", "Broadly these effects fall into two categories aiming either to suppress or neutralize the enemy or to cause casualties damage and destruction ", "This is mostly achieved by delivering high explosive munitions to suppress or inflict casualties on the enemy from casing fragments and other debris and from blast or by destroying enemy positions equipment and vehicles ", "Non lethal munitions notably smoke can also suppress or neutralize the enemy by obscuring their view ", "Fire may be directed by an artillery observer or another observer including crewed and uncrewed aircraft or called onto map coordinates ", "Military doctrine has had a significant influence on the core engineering design considerations of artillery ordnance through its history in seeking to achieve a balance between the delivered volume of fire with ordnance mobility ", "However during the modern period the consideration of protecting the gunners also arose due to the late th century introduction of the new generation of infantry weapons using conoidal bullet better known as the Mini ball with a range almost as long as that of field artillery ", "The gunners increasing proximity to and participation in direct combat against other combat arms and attacks by aircraft made the introduction of a gun shield necessary ", "The problems of how to employ a fixed or horse towed gun in mobile warfare necessitated the development of new methods of transporting the artillery into combat ", "Two distinct forms of artillery were developed the towed gun used primarily to attack or defend a fixed line and the self propelled gun intended to accompany a mobile force and to provide continuous fire support and or suppression ", "These influences have guided the development of artillery ordnance systems organizations and operations until the present with artillery systems capable of providing support at ranges from as little as m to the intercontinental ranges of ballistic missiles ", "The only combat in which artillery is unable to take part is close quarters combat with the possible exception of artillery reconnaissance teams ", " The word as used in the current context originated in the Middle Ages ", "One suggestion is that it comes from French atelier meaning the place where manual work is done ", "Another suggestion is that it originates from the th century and the Old French artillier designating craftsmen and manufacturers of all materials and warfare equipments spears swords armor war machines and for the next years the sense of the word artillery covered all forms of military weapons ", "Hence the naming of the Honourable Artillery Company which was essentially an infantry unit until the th century ", "Another suggestion is that it comes from the Italian arte de tirare art of shooting coined by one of the first theorists on the use of artillery Niccol Tartaglia ", "Mechanical systems used for throwing ammunition in ancient warfare also known as engines of war like the catapult onager trebuchet and

large artillery pieces ", "The artillery revolution in Europe caught on during the Hundred Years War and changed the way that battles were fought ", "In the preceding decades the English had even used a gunpowder like weapon in military campaigns against the Scottish ", " However at this time the cannons used in battle were very small and not particularly powerful ", "Cannons were only useful for the defense of a castle as demonstrated at Breteuil in when the besieged English used a cannon to destroy an attacking French assault tower ", " By the end of the th century cannon were only powerful enough to knock in roofs and could not penetrate castle walls ", "However a major change occurred between and when artillery became much more powerful and could now batter strongholds and fortresses quite efficiently ", "The English French and Burgundians all advanced in military technology and as a result the traditional advantage that went to the defense in a siege was lost ", "The cannon during this period were elongated and the recipe for gunpowder was improved to make it three times as powerful as before ", " These changes led to the increased power in the artillery weapons of the time ", "Joan of Arc encountered gunpowder weaponry several times ", "When she led the French against the English at the Battle of Tourelles in she faced heavy gunpowder fortifications and yet her troops prevailed in that battle ", "In addition she led assaults against the English held towns of Jargeau Meung and Beaugency all with the support of large artillery units ", "When she led the assault on Paris Joan faced stiff artillery fire especially from the suburb of St Denis which ultimately led to her defeat in this battle ", "In April she went to battle against the Burgundians whose support was purchased by the English ", "At this time the Burgundians had the strongest and largest gunpowder arsenal among the European powers and yet the French under Joan of Arc s leadership were able to beat back the Burgundians and defend themselves ", " As a result most of the battles of the Hundred Years War that Joan of Arc participated in were fought with gunpowder artillery ", "The army of Mehmet the Conqueror which conquered Constantinople in included both artillery and foot soldiers armed with gunpowder weapons ", " The Ottomans brought to the siege sixty nine guns in fifteen

role in the Battle of St Jakob an der Birs of ", "Early cannon were not always reliable King James II of Scotland was killed by the accidental explosion of one of his own cannon imported from Flanders at the siege of Roxburgh Castle in ", "The able use of artillery supported to a large measure the expansion and defense of the Portuguese Empire as it was a necessary tool that allowed the Portuguese to face overwhelming odds both on land and sea from Morocco to Asia ", " In great sieges and in sea battles the Portuguese demonstrated a level of proficiency in the use of artillery after the beginning of the th century unequalled by contemporary European neighbours in part due to the experience gained in intense fighting in Morocco which served as a proving ground for artillery and its pratical application and made Portugal a forerunner in gunnery for decades ", " During the reign of King Manuel at least cannon were sent to Morocco for garrison defense with more than cannon estimated to have been required during that year period ", " An especially noticeable division between siege guns and anti personnel guns inhanced the use and effectiveness of Portuguese firearms above contemporary powers making cannon the most essential element in the Portuguese arsenal ", " The three major classes of Portuguese artillery were anti personnel guns with a high borelenght

close range and burst on contact ", " The most popular in Portuguese arsenals was the ber o a cm one pounder bronze breech loading cannon that weighted kg with an effective range of meters ", " A tactical innovation the Portuguese introduced in fort defense was the use of combinations of projectiles against massed assaults ", " Although cannister shells had been developed in the early th century the Portuguese were the first to employ them extensively and Portuguese engineers invented a cannister round which consisted of a thin lead case filled with iron pellets that broke up at the muzzle and scattered its contents in a narrow pattern ", " An innovation which Portugal adopted in advance of other European powers was fuse delayed action shells and were commonly used in ", " Although dangerous their effectiveness meant a sixth of all rounds used by the Portuguese in Morocco were of the fused shell variety ", " The new Ming Dynasty established the Divine Engine Battalion

lack of a field carriage immobility once emplaced highly individual design and noted unreliability in James II King of Scots was killed when one exploded at the siege of Roxburgh ", "Their large size precluded the barrels being cast and they were constructed out of metal staves or rods bound together with hoops like a barrel giving their name to the gun barrel ", " page needed The use of the word cannon marks the introduction in the th century of a dedicated field carriage with axle trail and animal drawn limber this produced mobile field pieces that could move and support an army in action rather than being found only in the siege and static defenses ", "The reduction in the size of the barrel was due to improvements in both iron technology and gunpowder manufacture while the development of trunnions projections at the side of the cannon as an integral part of the cast allowed the barrel to be fixed to a more movable base and also made raising or lowering the barrel much

Kazimierz Siemienowicz Artis Magnae Artilleriae pars prima was one of the most important contemporary publications on the subject of artillery ", "For over two centuries this work was used in Europe as a basic artillery manual ", " One of the most significant effects of artillery during this period was however somewhat more indirect by easily reducing to rubble any medieval type fortification or city wall some which had stood since Roman times it abolished millennia of siege warfare strategies and styles of fortification building ", " This led among other things to a frenzy of new bastion style fortifications to be built all over Europe and in its colonies but also had a strong integrating effect on emerging nation states as kings were able to use their newfound artillery superiority to force any local dukes or lords to submit to their will setting the stage for the absolutist kingdoms to come ", " Modern rocket artillery can trace its heritage back to the Mysorean rockets of India ", "Their first recorded use was in during the battles of the Second Third and Fourth Mysore Wars ", "The wars fought between the British East India Company and the Kingdom of Mysore in India made use of the rockets as a weapon ", "In the Battle of Pollilur the Siege of Seringapatam and in Battle of Seringapatam in these rockets were used with considerable effect against the British ", " After the wars several Mysore rockets were sent to England but experiments with heavier payloads were unsuccessful ", "In William Congreve considering the Mysorian rockets to have too short a range less than yards developed rockets in numerous sizes with ranges up to yards and eventually utilizing iron casing as the Congreve rocket which were used effectively during the Napoleonic Wars and the War of ", " With the Napoleonic Wars artillery experienced changes in both physical design and operation ", "Rather than being overseen by mechanics artillery was viewed as its own service branch with the capability of dominating the battlefield ", "The success of the French artillery companies was at least in part due to the presence of specially trained artillery officers leading and coordinating during the chaos of battle ", " Napoleon himself a former artillery officer perfected the tactic of massed artillery batteries unleashed upon a critical point in his enemies line as a prelude to a decisive infantry and cavalry assault ", "Physically cannons continued to become smaller and lighter ", "During the Seven Years War King Frederick II of Prussia used these advances to deploy horse artillery that could move throughout the battlefield ", "Frederick also introduced the reversible iron ramrod which was much more resistant to breakage than older wooden designs ", "The reversibility aspect also helped increase the rate of fire since a soldier would no longer have to worry about what end of the ramrod they were using ", " Jean Baptiste de Gribeauval a French artillery engineer introduced the standardization of cannon design in the mid th century ", "He developed a inch mm field howitzer whose gun barrel carriage assembly and ammunition specifications were made uniform for all French cannons ", "The standardized interchangeable parts of these cannons down to the nuts bolts and screws made their mass production and repair much easier ", "While the Gribeauval system made for more efficient production and assembly the carriages used were heavy and the gunners were forced to march on foot instead of riding on the limber and gun as in the British system ", " Each cannon was named for the weight of its projectiles giving us variants such as and indicating the weight in pounds ", "The projectiles themselves included solid balls or canister containing lead bullets or other material ", "These canister shots acted as massive shotguns peppering the target with hundreds of projectiles at close range ", " The solid balls known as round shot was most effective when fired at shoulder height across a flat open area ", "The ball would tear through the ranks of the enemy or bounce along the ground breaking legs and ankles ", " The development of modern artillery occurred in the mid to late th century as a result of the convergence of various improvements in the underlying technology ", "Advances in metallurgy allowed for the construction of breech loading rifled guns that could fire at a much greater muzzle velocity ", "After the British artillery was shown up in the Crimean War as having barely changed since the Napoleonic Wars the industrialist William Armstrong was awarded a contract by the government to design a new piece of artillery ", "Production started in at the Elswick Ordnance Company and the Royal Arsenal at Woolwich and the outcome was the revolutionary Armstrong Gun which marked the birth of modern artillery ", " Three of its features particularly stand out ", "First the piece was rifled which allowed for a much more accurate and powerful action ", "Although rifling had been tried on small arms since the th century the necessary machinery to accurately rifle artillery was not available until the mid th century ", "Martin von Wahrendorff and Joseph Whitworth independently produced rifled cannon in the s but it was Armstrong s gun that was first to see widespread use during the Crimean War ", " The cast iron shell of the Armstrong gun was similar in shape to a Mini ball and had a thin lead coating which made it fractionally larger than the gun s bore and which engaged with the gun s rifling grooves to impart spin to the shell ", "This spin together with the elimination of windage as a result of the tight fit enabled the gun to achieve greater range and accuracy than existing smooth bore muzzle loaders with a smaller powder charge ", "His gun was also a breech loader ", "Although attempts at breech loading mechanisms had been made since medieval times the essential engineering problem was that the mechanism could not withstand the explosive charge ", "It was only with the advances in metallurgy and precision engineering capabilities during the Industrial Revolution that Armstrong was able to construct a viable solution ", "The gun combined all the properties that make up an effective artillery piece ", "The gun was mounted on a carriage in such a way as to return the gun to firing position after the recoil ", "What made the gun really revolutionary lay in the technique of the construction of the gun barrel that allowed it to withstand much more powerful explosive forces ", "The built up method involved assembling the barrel with wrought iron later mild steel was used tubes of successively smaller diameter ", " The tube would then be heated to allow it to expand and fit over the previous tube ", "When it cooled the gun would contract although not back to its original size which allowed an even pressure along the walls of the gun which was directed inward against the outward forces that the gun s firing exerted on the barrel ", " Another innovative feature more usually associated with th century guns was what Armstrong called its grip which was essentially a squeeze bore the inches of the bore at the muzzle end was of slightly smaller diameter which centered the shell before it left the barrel and at the same time slightly swaged down its lead coating reducing its diameter and slightly improving its ballistic qualities ", "Armstrong s system was adopted in initially for special service in the field and initially he produced only smaller artillery pieces pounder in mm mountain or light field guns pounder in mm guns for horse artillery and pounder inches mm field guns ", "The first cannon to contain all modern features is generally considered to be the French of ", " The gun used cased ammunition was breech loading had modern sights and a self contained firing mechanism ", "It was the first field gun to include a hydro pneumatic recoil mechanism which kept the gun s trail and wheels perfectly still during the firing sequence ", "Since it did not need to be re aimed after each shot the crew could fire as soon as the barrel returned to its resting position ", "In typical use the French could deliver fifteen rounds per minute on its target either shrapnel or melinite high explosive up to about miles m away ", "Its firing rate could even reach close to rounds per minute albeit only for a very short time and with a highly experienced crew ", "These were rates that contemporary bolt action rifles could not match ", "Indirect fire the firing of a projectile without relying on direct line of sight between the gun and the target possibly dates back to the th century ", " Early battlefield use of indirect fire may have occurred at Paltzig in July when the Russian artillery fired over the tops of trees and at the Battle of Waterloo where a battery of the Royal Horse Artillery fired shrapnel indirectly against advancing French troops ", " In Russian Lieutenant Colonel KG Guk published Indirect Fire for Field Artillery which provided a practical method of using aiming points for indirect fire by describing all the essentials of aiming points crest clearance and corrections to fire by an observer ", " A few years later the Richtfl che lining plane sight was invented in Germany and provided a means of indirect laying in azimuth complementing the clinometers for indirect laying in elevation which already existed ", "Despite conservative opposition within the German army indirect fire was adopted as doctrine by the s ", "In the early s Goertz in Germany developed an optical sight for azimuth laying ", "It quickly replaced the lining plane in English it became the Dial Sight UK or Panoramic Telescope US ", "The British halfheartedly experimented with indirect fire techniques since the s but with the onset of the Boer War they were the first to apply the theory in practice in although they had to improvise without a lining plane sight ", " In the next years leading up to World War I the techniques of indirect fire became available for all types of artillery ", "Indirect fire was the defining characteristic of th century artillery and led to undreamt of changes in the amount of artillery its tactics organisation and techniques most of which occurred during World War I ", "An implication of indirect fire and improving guns was increasing range between gun and target this increased the time of flight and the vertex of the trajectory ", "The result was decreasing accuracy the increasing distance between the target and the mean point of impact of the shells aimed at it caused by the increasing effects of non standard conditions ", "Indirect firing data was based on standard conditions including a specific muzzle velocity zero wind air temperature and density and propellant temperature ", "In practice this standard combination of conditions almost never existed they varied throughout the day and day to day and the greater the time of flight the greater the inaccuracy ", "An added complication was the need for survey to accurately fix the coordinates of the gun position and provide accurate orientation for the guns ", "Of course targets had to be accurately located but by air photo interpretation techniques enabled this and ground survey techniques could sometimes be used ", "In the methods of correcting firing data for the actual conditions were often convoluted and the availability of data about actual conditions was rudimentary or non existent the assumption was that fire would always be ranged adjusted ", "British heavy artillery worked energetically to progressively solve all these problems from late onwards and by early had effective processes in place for both field and heavy artillery ", "These processes enabled map shooting later called predicted fire it meant that effective fire could be delivered against an accurately located target without ranging ", "Nevertheless the mean point of impact was still some tens of yards from the target centre aiming point ", "It was not precision fire but it was good enough for concentrations and barrages ", "These processes remain in use into the st century with refinements to calculations enabled by computers and improved data capture about non standard conditions ", "The British major general Henry Hugh Tudor pioneered armour and artillery cooperation at the breakthrough Battle of Cambrai ", "The improvements in providing and using data for non standard conditions propellant temperature muzzle velocity wind air temperature and barometric pressure were developed by the major combatants throughout the war and enabled effective predicted fire ", " The effectiveness of this was demonstrated by the British in at Cambrai and by Germany the following year Operation Michael ", "Major General J B A ", "Bailey British Army retired wrote From the middle of the eighteenth century to the middle of the nineteenth artillery is judged to have accounted for perhaps of battlefield casualties ", "In the sixty years preceding this figure was probably as low as percent ", "The remaining percent fell to small arms whose range and accuracy had come to rival those of artillery ", " By WWI The British Royal Artillery at over one million men grew to be larger than the Royal Navy ", "Bellamy pp ", " cites the percentage of casualties caused by artillery in various theaters since in the First World War percent of Russian casualties and percent of British casualties on the Western Front in the Second World War percent of British casualties in North Africa and percent of Soviet casualties percent in and percent of German casualties on the Eastern Front and in the Korean War percent of US casualties including those inflicted by mortars ", " An estimated French soldiers were casualties of friendly artillery fire in the four years of World War I ", " Modern artillery is most obviously distinguished by its long range firing an explosive shell or rocket and a mobile carriage for firing and transport ", "However its most important characteristic is the use of indirect fire whereby the firing equipment is aimed without seeing the target through its sights ", "Indirect fire emerged at the beginning of the th century and was greatly enhanced by the development of predicted fire methods in World War I ", "However indirect fire was area fire it was and is not suitable for destroying point targets its primary purpose is area suppression ", "Nevertheless by the late s precision guided munitions started to appear notably the US mm Copperhead and its Soviet mm Krasnopol equivalent that had success in Indian service ", "These relied on laser designation to illuminate the target that the shell homed onto ", "However in the early st century the Global Positioning System GPS enabled relatively cheap and accurate guidance for shells and missiles notably the US mm Excalibur and the mm GMLRS rocket ", "The introduction of these led to a new issue the need for very accurate three dimensional target coordinates the mensuration process ", " Weapons covered by the term modern artillery include cannon artillery such as howitzer mortar and field gun and rocket artillery ", "Certain smaller caliber mortars are more properly designated small arms rather than artillery albeit indirect fire small arms ", "This term also came to include coastal artillery which traditionally defended coastal areas against seaborne attack and controlled the passage of ships ", "With the advent of powered flight at the start of the th century artillery also included ground based anti aircraft batteries ", "The term artillery has traditionally not been used for projectiles with internal guidance systems preferring the term missilery though some modern artillery units employ surface to surface missiles ", "Advances in terminal guidance systems for small munitions has allowed large caliber guided projectiles to be developed blurring this distinction ", " See Long Range Precision Fires LRPF Joint terminal attack controllerOne of the most important roles of logistics is the supply of munitions as a primary type of artillery consumable their storage ammunition dump arsenal magazine and the provision of fuzes detonators and warheads at the point where artillery troops will assemble the charge projectile bomb or shell ", "A round of artillery ammunition comprises four components Fuzes are the devices that initiate an artillery projectile either to detonate its High Explosive HE filling or eject its cargo illuminating flare or smoke canisters being examples ", "The official military spelling is fuze ", " Broadly there are four main types Most artillery fuzes are nose fuzes ", "However base fuzes have been used with armor piercing shells and for squash head High Explosive Squash Head HESH or High Explosive Plastic HEP anti tank shells ", "At least one nuclear shell and its non nuclear spotting version also used a multi deck mechanical time fuze fitted into its base ", "Impact fuzes were and in some armies remain the standard fuze for HE projectiles ", "Their default action is normally superquick some have had a graze action which allows them to penetrate light cover and others have delay ", "Delay fuzes allow the shell to penetrate the ground before exploding ", "Armor or Concrete Piercing AP or CP fuzes are specially hardened ", "During World War I and later ricochet fire with delay or graze fuzed HE shells fired with a flat angle of descent was used to achieve airburst ", "HE shells can be fitted with other fuzes ", "Airburst fuzes usually have a combined airburst and impact function ", "However until the introduction of proximity fuzes the airburst function was mostly used with cargo munitions for example shrapnel illumination and smoke ", "The larger calibers of anti aircraft artillery are almost always used airburst ", "Airburst fuzes have to have the fuze length running time set on them ", "This is done just before firing using either a wrench or a fuze setter pre set to the required fuze length ", "Early airburst fuzes used igniferous timers which lasted into the second half of the th century ", "Mechanical time fuzes appeared in the early part of the century ", "These required a means of powering them ", "The Thiel mechanism used a spring and escapement i e ", " clockwork Junghans used centrifugal force and gears and Dixi used centrifugal force and balls ", "From about electronic time fuzes started replacing mechanical ones for use with cargo munitions ", "Proximity fuzes have been of two types photo electric or radar ", "The former was not very successful and seems only to have been used with British anti aircraft artillery unrotated projectiles rockets in World War II ", "Radar proximity fuzes were a big improvement over the mechanical time fuzes which they replaced ", "Mechanical time fuzes required an accurate calculation of their running time which was affected by non standard conditions ", "With HE requiring a burst to feet m above the ground if this was very slightly wrong the rounds would either hit the ground or burst too high ", "Accurate running time was less important with cargo munitions that burst much higher ", "The first radar proximity fuzes perhaps originally codenamed VT and later called Variable Time VT were invented by the British and developed by the US and initially used against aircraft in World War II ", "Their ground use was delayed for fear of the enemy recovering blinds artillery shells which failed to detonate and copying the fuze ", "The first proximity fuzes were designed to detonate about feet m above the ground ", "These air bursts are much more lethal against personnel than ground bursts because they deliver a greater proportion of useful fragments and deliver them into terrain where a prone soldier would be protected from ground bursts ", "However proximity fuzes can suffer premature detonation because of the moisture in heavy rain clouds ", "This led to Controlled Variable Time CVT after World War II ", "These fuzes have a mechanical timer that switched on the radar about seconds before expected impact they also detonated on impact ", "The proximity fuze emerged on the battlefields of Europe in late December ", "They have become known as the U S ", "Artillery s Christmas present and were much appreciated when they arrived during the Battle of the Bulge ", "They were also used to great effect in anti aircraft projectiles in the Pacific against kamikaze as well as in Britain against V flying bombs ", " Electronic multi function fuzes started to appear around ", "Using solid state electronics they were relatively cheap and reliable and became the standard fitted fuze in operational ammunition stocks in some western armies ", "The early versions were often limited to proximity airburst albeit with height of burst options and impact ", "Some offered a go no go functional test through the fuze setter ", "Later versions introduced induction fuze setting and testing instead of physically placing a fuze setter on the fuze ", "The latest such as Junghan s DM U provide options giving superquick delay a choice of proximity heights of burst time and a choice of foliage penetration depths ", "A new type of artillery fuze will appear soon ", "In addition to other functions these offer some course correction capability not full precision but sufficient to significantly reduce the dispersion of the shells on the ground ", "The projectile is the munition or bullet fired downrange ", "This may be an explosive device ", "Projectiles have traditionally been classified as shot or shell the former being solid and the latter having some form of payload ", "Shells can be divided into three configurations bursting base ejection or nose ejection ", "The latter is sometimes called the shrapnel configuration ", "The most modern is base ejection which was introduced in World War I ", "Base and nose ejection are almost always used with airburst fuzes ", "Bursting shells use various types of fuze depending on the nature of the payload and the tactical need at the time ", "Payloads have included Most forms of artillery require a propellant to propel the projectile at the target ", "Propellant is always a low explosive which means it deflagrates rather than detonating like high explosives ", "The shell is accelerated to a high velocity in a very short time by the rapid generation of gas from the burning propellant ", "This high pressure is achieved by burning the propellant in a contained area either the chamber of a gun barrel or the combustion chamber of a rocket motor ", "Until the late th century the only available propellant was black powder ", "It had many disadvantages as a propellant it has relatively low power requiring large amounts of powder to fire projectiles and created thick clouds of white smoke that would obscure the targets betray the positions of guns and make aiming impossible ", "In nitrocellulose also known as guncotton was discovered and the high explosive nitroglycerin was discovered at nearly the same time ", "Nitrocellulose was significantly more powerful than black powder and was smokeless ", "Early guncotton was unstable however and burned very fast and hot leading to greatly increased barrel wear ", "Widespread introduction of smokeless powder would wait until the advent of the double base powders which combine

characteristics of a good artillery propellant low temperature high energy non corrosive highly stable cheap and easy to manufacture in large quantities ", "Modern gun propellants are broadly divided into three classes single base propellants that are mainly or entirely nitrocellulose based double base propellants consisting of a combination of nitrocellulose and nitroglycerin and triple base composed of a combination of nitrocellulose and nitroglycerin and nitroguanidine ", "Artillery shells fired from a barrel can be assisted to greater range in three ways Propelling charges for barrel artillery can be provided either as cartridge bags or in metal cartridge cases ", "Generally anti aircraft artillery and smaller caliber up to or mm guns use metal cartridge cases that include the round and propellant similar to a modern rifle cartridge ", "This simplifies loading and is necessary for very high rates of fire ", "Bagged propellant allows the amount of powder to be raised or lowered depending on the range to the target ", "It also makes handling of larger shells easier ", "Cases and bags require totally different types of breech ", "A metal case holds an integral primer to initiate the propellant and provides the gas seal to prevent the gases leaking out of the breech this is called obturation ", "With bagged charges the breech itself provides obturation and holds the primer ", "In either case the primer is usually percussion but electrical is also used and laser ignition is emerging ", "Modern mm guns have a primer magazine fitted to their breech ", "Artillery ammunition has four classifications according to use Because modern field artillery mostly uses indirect fire the guns have to be part of a system that enables them to attack targets invisible to them in accordance with the combined arms plan ", "The main functions in the field artillery system are All these calculations to produce a quadrant elevation or range and azimuth were done manually using instruments tabulated data of the moment and approximations until battlefield computers started appearing in the s and s ", "While some early calculators copied the manual method typically substituting polynomials for tabulated data computers use a different approach ", "They simulate a shell s trajectory by flying it in short steps and applying data about the conditions affecting the trajectory at each step ", "This simulation is repeated until it produces a quadrant elevation and azimuth that lands the shell within the required closing distance of the target coordinates ", "NATO has a standard ballistic model for computer calculations and has expanded the scope of this into the NATO Armaments Ballistic Kernel NABK within the SG Shareable Fire Control Software Suite S ", "Supply of artillery ammunition has always been a major component of military logistics ", "Up until World War I some armies made artillery responsible for all forward ammunition supply because the load of small arms ammunition was trivial compared to artillery ", "Different armies use different approaches to ammunition supply which can vary with the nature of operations ", "Differences include where the logistic service transfers artillery ammunition to artillery the amount of ammunition carried in units and extent to which stocks are held at unit or battery level ", "A key difference is whether supply is push or pull ", "In the former the pipeline keeps pushing ammunition into formations or units at a defined rate ", "In the latter units fire as tactically necessary and replenish to maintain or reach their authorised holding which can vary so the logistic system has to be able to cope with surge and slack ", "Artillery types can be categorised in several ways for example by type or size of weapon or ordnance by role or by organizational arrangements ", "The types of cannon artillery are generally distinguished by the velocity at which they fire projectiles ", "Types of artillery Modern field artillery can also be split into two other subcategories towed and self propelled ", "As the name suggests towed artillery has a prime mover usually an artillery tractor or truck to move the piece crew and ammunition around ", "Towed artillery is in some cases equipped with an APU for small displacements ", "Self propelled artillery is permanently mounted on a carriage or vehicle with room for the crew and ammunition and is thus capable of moving quickly from one firing position to another both to support the fluid nature of modern combat and to avoid counter battery fire ", "It includes mortar carrier vehicles many of which allow the mortar to be removed from the vehicle and be used dismounted potentially in terrain in which the vehicle cannot navigate or in order to avoid detection ", "At the beginning of the modern artillery period the late th century many armies had three main types of artillery in some case they were sub branches within the artillery branch in others they were separate branches or corps ", "There were also other types excluding the armament fitted to warships After World War I many nations merged these different artillery branches in some cases keeping some as sub branches ", "Naval artillery disappeared apart from that belonging to marines ", "However two new branches of artillery emerged during that war and its aftermath both used specialised guns and a few rockets and used direct not indirect fire in the s and s both started to make extensive use of missiles However the general switch by artillery to indirect fire before and during World War I led to a reaction in some armies ", "The result was accompanying or infantry guns ", "These were usually small short range guns that could be easily man handled and used mostly for direct fire but some could use indirect fire ", "Some were operated by the artillery branch but under command of the supported unit ", "In World War II they were joined by self propelled assault guns although other armies adopted infantry or close support tanks in armoured branch units for the same purpose subsequently tanks generally took on the accompanying role ", "The three main types of artillery gun are guns howitzers and mortars ", "During the th century guns and howitzers have steadily merged in artillery use making a distinction between the terms somewhat meaningless ", "By the end of the th century true guns with calibers larger than about mm have become very rare in artillery use the main users being tanks ships and a few residual anti aircraft and coastal guns ", "The term cannon is a United States generic term that includes guns howitzers and mortars it is not used in other English speaking armies ", "The traditional definitions differentiated between guns and howitzers in terms of maximum elevation well less than as opposed to close to or greater than number of charges one or more than one charge and having higher or lower muzzle velocity sometimes indicated by barrel length ", "These three criteria give eight possible combinations of which guns and howitzers are but two ", "However modern howitzers have higher velocities and longer barrels than the equivalent guns of the first half of the th century ", "True guns are characterized by long range having a maximum elevation significantly less than a high muzzle velocity and hence a relatively long barrel smooth bore no rifling and a single charge ", "The latter often led to fixed ammunition where the projectile is locked to the cartridge case ", "There is no generally accepted minimum muzzle velocity or barrel length associated with a gun ", "Howitzers can fire at maximum elevations at least close to elevations up to about are normal for modern howitzers ", "Howitzers also have a choice of charges meaning that the same elevation angle of fire will achieve a different range depending on the charge used ", "They have rifled bores lower muzzle velocities and shorter barrels than equivalent guns ", "All this means they can deliver fire with a steep angle of descent ", "Because of their multi charge capability their ammunition is mostly separate loading the projectile and propellant are loaded separately ", "That leaves six combinations of the three criteria some of which have been termed gun howitzers ", "A term first used in the s when howitzers with a relatively high maximum muzzle velocities were introduced it never became widely accepted most armies electing to widen the definition of gun or howitzer ", "By the s most equipment had maximum elevations up to about were multi charge had quite high maximum muzzle velocities and relatively long barrels ", "Mortars are simpler ", "The modern mortar originated in World War I and there were several patterns ", "After that war most mortars settled on the Stokes pattern characterized by a short barrel smooth bore low muzzle velocity elevation angle of firing generally greater than and a very simple and light mounting using a baseplate on the ground ", "The projectile with its integral propelling charge was dropped down the barrel from the muzzle to hit a fixed firing pin ", "Since that time a few mortars have become rifled and adopted breech loading ", "There are other recognized typifying characteristics for artillery ", "One such characteristic is the type of obturation used to seal the chamber and prevent gases escaping through the breech ", "This may use a metal cartridge case that also holds the propelling charge a configuration called QF or quickfiring by some nations ", "The alternative does not use a metal cartridge case the propellant being merely bagged or in combustible cases with the breech itself providing all the sealing ", "This is called BL or breech loading by some nations ", "A second characteristic is the form of propulsion ", "Modern equipment can either be towed or self propelled SP ", "A towed gun fires from the ground and any inherent protection is limited to a gun shield ", "Towing by horse teams lasted throughout World War II in some armies but others were fully mechanized with wheeled or tracked gun towing vehicles by the outbreak of that war ", "The size of a towing vehicle depends on the weight of the equipment and the amount of ammunition it has to carry ", "A variation of towed is portee where the vehicle carries the gun which is dismounted for firing ", "Mortars are often carried this way ", "A mortar is sometimes carried in an armored vehicle and can either fire from it or be dismounted to fire from the ground ", "Since the early s it has been possible to carry lighter towed guns and most mortars by helicopter ", "Even before that they were parachuted or landed by glider from the time of the first airborne trials in the USSR in the s ", "In SP equipment the gun is an integral part of the vehicle that carries it ", "SPs first appeared during World War I but did not really develop until World War II ", "They are mostly tracked vehicles but wheeled SPs started to appear in the s ", "Some SPs have no armor and carry few or no other weapons and ammunition ", "Armored SPs usually carry a useful ammunition load ", "Early armored SPs were mostly a casemate configuration in essence an open top armored box offering only limited traverse ", "However most modern armored SPs have a full enclosed armored turret usually giving full traverse for the gun ", "Many SPs cannot fire without deploying stabilizers or spades sometimes hydraulic ", "A few SPs are designed so that the recoil forces of the gun are transferred directly onto the ground through a baseplate ", "A few towed guns have been given limited self propulsion by means of an auxiliary engine ", "Two other forms of tactical propulsion were used in the first half of the th century Railways or transporting the equipment by road as two or three separate loads with disassembly and re assembly at the beginning and end of the journey ", "Railway artillery took two forms railway mountings for heavy and super heavy guns and howitzers and armored trains as fighting vehicles armed with light artillery in a direct fire role ", "Disassembled transport was also used with heavy and super heavy weapons and lasted into the s ", "A third form of artillery typing is to classify it as light medium heavy and various other terms ", "It appears to have been introduced in World War I which spawned a very wide array of artillery in all sorts of sizes so a simple categorical system was needed ", "Some armies defined these categories by bands of calibers ", "Different bands were used for different types of weapons field guns mortars anti aircraft guns and coastal guns ", " citation needed List of countries in order of amount of artillery only conventional barrel ordnance is given in use with land forces Artillery is used in a variety of roles depending on its type and caliber ", "The general role of artillery is to provide fire support the application of fire coordinated with the manoeuvre of forces to destroy neutralize or suppress the enemy ", "This NATO definition makes artillery a supporting arm although not all NATO armies agree with this logic ", "The italicised terms are NATO s ", " Unlike rockets guns or howitzers as some armies still call them and mortars are suitable for delivering close supporting fire ", "However they are all suitable for providing deep supporting fire although the limited range of many mortars tends to exclude them from the role ", "Their control arrangements and limited range also mean that mortars are most suited to direct supporting fire ", "Guns are used either for this or general supporting fire while rockets are mostly used for the latter ", "However lighter rockets may be used for direct fire support ", "These rules of thumb apply to NATO armies ", "Modern mortars because of their lighter weight and simpler more transportable design are usually an integral part of infantry and in some armies armor units ", "This means they generally do not have to concentrate their fire so their shorter range is not a disadvantage ", "Some armies also consider infantry operated mortars to be more responsive than artillery but this is a function of the control arrangements and not the case in all armies ", "However mortars have always been used by artillery units and remain with them in many armies including a few in NATO ", "In NATO armies artillery is usually assigned a tactical mission that establishes its relationship and responsibilities to the formation or units it is assigned to ", "It seems that not all NATO nations use the terms and outside NATO others are probably used ", "The standard terms are direct support general support general support reinforcing and reinforcing ", "These tactical missions are in the context of the command authority operational command operational control tactical command or tactical control ", "In NATO direct support generally means that the directly supporting artillery unit provides observers and liaison to the manoeuvre troops being supported typically an artillery battalion or equivalent is assigned to a brigade and its batteries to the brigade s battalions ", "However some armies achieve this by placing the assigned artillery units under command of the directly supported formation ", "Nevertheless the batteries fire can be concentrated onto a single target as can the fire of units in range and with the other tactical missions ", "There are several dimensions to this subject ", "The first is the notion that fire may be against an opportunity target or may be prearranged ", "If it is the latter it may be either on call or scheduled ", "Prearranged targets may be part of a fire plan ", "Fire may be either observed or unobserved if the former it may be adjusted if the latter then it has to be predicted ", "Observation of adjusted fire may be directly by a forward observer or indirectly via some other target acquisition system ", "NATO also recognises several different types of fire support for tactical purposes These purposes have existed for most of the th century although their definitions have evolved and will continue to do so lack of suppression in counterbattery is an omission ", "Broadly they can be defined as either Two other NATO terms also need definition The tactical purposes also include various mission verbs a rapidly expanding subject with the modern concept of effects based operations ", "Targeting is the process of selecting target and matching the appropriate response to them taking account of operational requirements and capabilities ", "It requires consideration of the type of fire support required and the extent of coordination with the supported arm ", "It involves decisions about The targeting process is the key aspect of tactical fire control ", "Depending on the circumstances and national procedures it may all be undertaken in one place or may be distributed ", "In armies practicing control from the front most of the process may be undertaken by a forward observer or other target acquirer ", "This is particularly the case for a smaller target requiring only a few fire units ", "The extent to which the process is formal or informal and makes use of computer based systems documented norms or experience and judgement also varies widely armies and other circumstances ", "Surprise may be essential or irrelevant ", "It depends on what effects are required and whether or not the target is likely to move or quickly improve its protective posture ", "During World War II UK researchers concluded that for impact fuzed munitions the relative risk were as follows citation needed Airburst munitions significantly increase the relative risk for lying men etc ", "Historically most casualties occur in the first seconds of fire i e ", "the time needed to react and improve protective posture however this is less relevant if airburst is used ", "There are several ways of making best use of this brief window of maximum vulnerability Modern counter battery fire developed in World War I with the objective of defeating the enemy s artillery ", "Typically such fire was used to suppress enemy batteries when they were or were about to interfere with the activities of friendly forces such as to prevent enemy defensive artillery fire against an impending attack or to systematically destroy enemy guns ", "In World War I the latter required air observation ", "The first indirect counter battery fire was in May by an observer in a balloon ", " citation needed Enemy artillery can be detected in two ways either by direct observation of the guns from the air or by ground observers including specialist reconnaissance or from their firing signatures ", "This includes radars tracking the shells in flight to determine their place of origin sound ranging detecting guns firing and resecting their position from pairs of microphones or cross observation of gun flashes using observation by human observers or opto electronic devices although the widespread adoption of flashless propellant limited the effectiveness of the latter ", "Once hostile batteries have been detected they may be engaged immediately by friendly artillery or later at an optimum time depending on the tactical situation and the counter battery policy ", "Air strike is another option ", "In some situations the task is to locate all active enemy batteries for attack using a counter battery fire at the appropriate moment in accordance with a plan developed by artillery intelligence staff ", "In other situations counter battery fire may occur whenever a battery is located with sufficient accuracy ", "Modern counter battery target acquisition uses unmanned aircraft counter battery radar ground reconnaissance and sound ranging ", "Counter battery fire may be adjusted by some of the systems for example the operator of an unmanned aircraft can follow a battery if it moves ", "Defensive measures by batteries include frequently changing position or constructing defensive earthworks the tunnels used by North Korea being an extreme example ", "Counter measures include air defence against aircraft and attacking counter battery radars physically and electronically ", " Field Artillery Team is a US term and the following description and terminology applies to the US other armies are broadly similar but differ in significant details ", "Modern field artillery post World War I has three distinct parts the Forward Observer FO the Fire Direction Center FDC and the actual guns themselves ", "The forward observer observes the target using tools such as binoculars laser rangefinders designators and call back fire missions on his radio or relays the data through a portable computer via an encrypted digital radio connection protected from jamming by computerized frequency hopping ", "A lesser known part of the team is the FAS or Field Artillery Survey team which sets up the Gun Line for the cannons ", "Today most artillery battalions use a n Aiming Circle which allows for faster setup and more mobility ", "FAS teams are still used for checks and balances purposes and if a gun battery has issues with the Aiming Circle a FAS team will do it for them ", "The FO can communicate directly with the battery FDC of which there is one per each battery of guns ", "Otherwise the several FOs communicate with a higher FDC such as at a Battalion level and the higher FDC prioritizes the targets and allocates fires to individual batteries as needed to engage the targets that are spotted by the FOs or to perform preplanned fires ", "The Battery FDC computes firing data ammunition to be used powder charge fuse settings the direction to the target and the quadrant elevation to be fired at to reach the target what gun will fire any rounds needed for adjusting on the target and the number of rounds to be fired on the target by each gun once the target has been accurately located to the guns ", "Traditionally this data is relayed via radio or wire communications as a warning order to the guns followed by orders specifying the type of ammunition and fuse setting direction and the elevation needed to reach the target and the method of adjustment or orders for fire for effect FFE ", "However in more advanced artillery units this data is relayed through a digital radio link ", "Other parts of the field artillery team include meteorological analysis to determine the temperature humidity and pressure of the air and wind direction and speed at different altitudes ", "Also radar is used both for determining the location of enemy artillery and mortar batteries and to determine the precise actual strike points of rounds fired by battery and comparing that location with what was expected to compute a registration allowing future rounds to be fired with much greater accuracy ", "A technique called time on target TOT was developed by the British Army in North Africa at the end of and early particularly for counter battery fire and other concentrations it proved very popular ", "It relied on BBC time signals to enable officers to synchronize their watches to the second because this avoided the need to use military radio networks and the possibility of losing surprise and the need for field telephone networks in the desert ", " With this technique the time of flight from each fire unit battery or troop to the target is taken from the range or firing tables or the computer and each engaging fire unit subtracts its time of flight from the TOT to determine the time to fire ", "An executive order to fire is given to all guns in the fire unit at the correct moment to fire ", "When each fire unit fires their rounds at their individual firing time all the opening rounds will reach the target area almost simultaneously ", "This is especially effective when combined with techniques that allow fires for effect to be made without preliminary adjusting fires ", "Multiple round simultaneous impact MRSI is a modern version of the earlier time on target concept ", "MRSI is when a single gun fires multiple shells so all arrive at the same target simultaneously ", "This is possible because there is more than one trajectory for a round to fly to any given target ", "Typically one is below degrees from horizontal and the other is above it and by using different sized propellant charges with each shell it is possible to utilize more than two trajectories ", "Because the higher trajectories cause the shells to arc higher into the air they take longer to reach the target ", "If shells are fired on higher trajectories for initial volleys starting with the shell with the most propellant and working down and later volleys are fired on the lower trajectories with the correct timing the shells will all arrive at the same target simultaneously ", "This is useful because many more shells can land on the target with no warning ", "With traditional methods of firing the target area may have time however long it takes to reload and re fire the guns to take cover between volleys ", "However guns capable of burst fire can deliver multiple rounds in a few seconds if they use the same firing data for each and if guns in more than one location are firing on one target they can use Time on Target procedures so that all their shells arrive at the same time and target ", "MRSI has a few prerequisites ", "The first is guns with a high rate of fire ", "The second is the ability to use different sized propellant charges ", "Third is a fire control computer that has the ability to compute MRSI volleys and the capability to produce firing data sent to each gun and then presented to the gun commander in the correct order ", " The number of rounds that can be delivered in MRSI depends primarily on the range to the target and the rate of fire ", "To allow the most shells to reach the target the target has to be in range of the lowest propellant charge ", "Examples of guns with a rate of fire that makes them suitable for MRSI includes UK s AS South

Crusader program now cancelled was slated to have MRSI capability ", "It is unclear how many fire control computers have the necessary capabilities ", "Two round MRSI firings were a popular artillery demonstration in the s where well trained detachments could show off their skills for spectators ", "The destructiveness of artillery bombardments can be enhanced when some or all of the shells are set for airburst meaning that they explode in the air above the target instead of upon impact ", "This can be accomplished either through time fuzes or proximity fuzes ", "Time fuzes use a precise timer to detonate the shell after a preset delay ", "This technique is tricky and slight variations in the functioning of the fuze can cause it to explode too high and be ineffective or to strike the ground instead of exploding above it ", "Since December Battle of the Bulge proximity fuzed artillery shells have been available that take the guesswork out of this process ", "These employ a miniature low powered radar transmitter in the fuze to detect the ground and explode them at a predetermined height above it ", "The return of the weak radar signal completes an electrical circuit in the fuze which explodes the shell ", "The proximity fuze itself was developed by the British to increase the effectiveness of anti aircraft warfare ", "This is a very effective tactic against infantry and light vehicles because it scatters the fragmentation of the shell over a larger area and prevents it from being blocked by terrain or entrenchments that do not include some form of robust overhead cover ", "Combined with TOT or MRSI tactics that give no warning of the incoming rounds these rounds are especially devastating because many enemy soldiers are likely to be caught in the open even more so if the attack is launched against an assembly area or troops moving in the open rather than a unit in an entrenched tactical position ", "Numerous war memorials around the world incorporate an

aeroplanes were recognised ", " By only France and Germany had developed field guns suitable for engaging balloons and aircraft and addressed issues of military organisation ", "Britain s Royal Navy would soon introduce the QF inch and QF inch AA guns and also had Vickers pounder quick firing pom pom s that could be used in various mountings ", " The first US anti aircraft cannon was a pounder concept design by Admiral Twining in to meet the perceived threat of airships that eventually was used as the basis for the US Navy s first operational anti aircraft cannon the caliber gun ", " On the th of September troops of the Serbian Army observed three enemy aircraft approaching Kragujevac ", "Soldiers fired at them with shotguns and machine guns but failed to prevent them from dropping bombs over the city hitting military installations the railway station and many other mostly civilian targets in the city ", "During the bombing raid private Radoje Ljutovac fired his cannon at the enemy aircraft and successfully shot one down ", "It crashed in the city and both pilots died from their injuries ", "The cannon Ljutovac used was not designed as an anti aircraft gun it was a slightly modified Turkish cannon captured during the First Balkan War in ", "This was the first occasion in military history that a military aircraft was shot down with ground to air fire ", " The British recognised the need for anti aircraft capability a few weeks before World War I broke out on July the New York Times reported that the British government had decided to dot the coasts of the British Isles with a series of towers each armed with two quick firing guns of special design while a complete circle of towers was to be built around naval installations and at other especially vulnerable points ", "By December the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve RNVR was manning AA guns and searchlights assembled from various sources at some nine ports ", "The Royal Garrison Artillery RGA was given responsibility for AA defence in the field using motorised two gun sections ", "The first were formally formed in November ", "Initially they used QF pounder pom pom a mm version of the Maxim Gun ", " All armies soon deployed AA guns often based on their smaller field pieces notably the French mm and Russian mm typically simply propped up on some sort of embankment to get the muzzle pointed skyward ", "The British Army adopted the pounder quickly producing new mountings suitable for AA use the pdr QF cwt Mk III was issued in ", "It remained in service throughout the war but pdr guns were lined down to take the pdr shell with a larger cartridge producing the pr QF cwt and these proved much more satisfactory ", " However in general these ad hoc solutions proved largely useless ", "With little experience in the role no means of measuring target range height or speed the difficulty of observing their shell bursts relative to the target gunners proved unable to get their fuse setting correct and most rounds burst well below their targets ", "The exception to this rule was the guns protecting spotting balloons in which case the altitude could be accurately measured from the length of the cable holding the balloon ", "The first issue was ammunition ", "Before the war it was recognised that ammunition needed to explode in the air ", "Both high explosive HE and shrapnel were used mostly the former ", "Airburst fuses were either igniferious based on a burning fuse or mechanical clockwork ", "Igniferious fuses were not well suited for anti aircraft use ", "The fuse length was determined by time of flight but the burning rate of the gunpowder was affected by altitude ", "The British pom poms had only contact fused ammunition ", "Zeppelins being hydrogen filled balloons were targets for incendiary shells and the British introduced these with airburst fuses both shrapnel type forward projection of incendiary pot and base ejection of an incendiary stream ", "The British also fitted tracers to their shells for use at night ", "Smoke shells were also available for some AA guns these bursts were used as targets during training ", " German air attacks on the British Isles increased in and the AA efforts were deemed somewhat ineffective so a Royal Navy gunnery expert Admiral Sir Percy Scott was appointed to make improvements particularly an integrated AA defence for London ", "The air defences were expanded with more RNVR AA guns mm and inch the pom poms being ineffective ", "The naval inch was also adopted by the army the QF inch cwt mm a new field mounting was introduced in ", "Since most attacks were at night searchlights were soon used and acoustic methods of detection and locating were developed ", "By December there were AA Sections defending Britain most with the inch with the BEF in France and in the Middle East ", " AA gunnery was a difficult business ", "The problem was of successfully aiming a shell to burst close to its target s future position with various factors affecting the shells predicted trajectory ", "This was called deflection gun laying where off set angles for range and elevation were set on the gunsight and updated as their target moved ", "In this method when the sights were on the target the barrel was pointed at the target s future position ", "Range and height of the target determined fuse length ", "The difficulties increased as aircraft performance improved ", "The British dealt with range measurement first when it was realised that range was the key to producing a better fuse setting ", "This led to the Height Range Finder HRF the first model being the Barr Stroud UB a metre optical coincident rangefinder mounted on a tripod ", "It measured the distance to the target and the elevation angle which together gave the height of the aircraft ", "These were complex instruments and various other methods were also used ", "The HRF was soon joined by the Height Fuse Indicator HFI this was marked with elevation angles and height lines overlaid with fuse length curves using the height reported by the HRF operator the necessary fuse length could be read off ", " However the problem of deflection settings aim off required knowing the rate of change in the target s position ", "Both France and the UK introduced tachymetric devices to track targets and produce vertical and horizontal deflection angles ", "The French Brocq system was electrical the operator entered the target range and had displays at guns it was used with their mm ", "The British Wilson Dalby gun director used a pair of trackers and mechanical tachymetry the operator entered the fuse length and deflection angles were read from the instruments ", " By the start of World War I the mm had become the standard German weapon and came mounted on a large traverse that could be easily transported on a wagon ", "Krupp mm guns were supplied with an optical sighting system that improved their capabilities ", "The German Army also adapted a revolving cannon that came to be known to Allied fliers as the flaming onion from the shells in flight ", "This gun had five barrels that quickly launched a series of mm artillery shells ", " citation needed As aircraft started to be used against ground targets on the battlefield the AA guns could not be traversed quickly enough at close targets and being relatively few were not always in the right place and were often unpopular with other troops so changed positions frequently ", "Soon the forces were adding various machine gun based weapons mounted on poles ", "These short range weapons proved more deadly and the Red Baron is believed to have been shot down by an anti aircraft Vickers machine gun ", "When the war ended it was clear that the increasing capabilities of aircraft would require better means of acquiring targets and aiming at them ", "Nevertheless a pattern had been set anti aircraft warfare would employ heavy weapons to attack high altitude targets and lighter weapons for use when aircraft came to lower altitudes ", "World War I demonstrated that aircraft could be an important part of the battlefield but in some nations it was the prospect of strategic air attack that was the main issue presenting both a threat and an opportunity ", "The experience of four years of air attacks on London by Zeppelins and Gotha G V bombers had particularly influenced the British and was one of if not the main driver for forming an independent air force ", "As the capabilities of aircraft and their engines improved it was clear that their role in future war would be even more critical as their range and weapon load grew ", "However in the years immediately after World War I the prospect of another major war seemed remote particularly in Europe where the most militarily capable nations were and little financing was available ", "Four years of war had seen the creation of a new and technically demanding branch of military activity ", "Air defence had made huge advances albeit from a very low starting point ", "However it was new and often lacked influential friends in the competition for a share of limited defence budgets ", "Demobilisation meant that most AA guns were taken out of service leaving only the most modern ", "However there were lessons to be learned ", "In particular the British who had had AA guns in most theatres in action in daylight and used them against night attacks at home ", "Furthermore they had also formed an Anti Aircraft Experimental Section during the war and accumulated large amounts of data that was subjected to extensive analysis ", "As a result they published in the two volume Textbook of Anti Aircraft Gunnery ", "It included five key recommendations for HAA equipment Two assumptions underpinned the British approach to HAA fire first aimed fire was the primary method and this was enabled by predicting gun data from visually tracking the target and having its height ", "Second that the target would maintain a steady course speed and height ", "This HAA was to engage targets up to feet ", "Mechanical as opposed to igniferous time fuses were required because the speed of powder burning varied with height so fuse length was not a simple function of time of flight ", "Automated fire ensured a constant rate of fire that made it easier to predict where each shell should be individually aimed ", " In the British adopted a new instrument developed by Vickers ", "It was a mechanical analogue computer Predictor AA No ", "Given the target height its operators tracked the target and the predictor produced bearing quadrant elevation and fuse setting ", "These were passed electrically to the guns where they were displayed on repeater dials to the layers who matched pointers target data and the gun s actual data to lay the guns ", "This system of repeater electrical dials built on the arrangements introduced by British coast artillery in the s and coast artillery was the background of many AA officers ", "Similar systems were adopted in other countries and for example the later Sperry device designated M A in the US was also used by Britain as the Predictor AA No ", "Height finders were also increasing in size in Britain the World War I Barr Stroud UB foot optical base was replaced by the UB foot optical base and the UB foot optical base only used on static AA sites ", "Goertz in Germany and Levallois in France produced metre instruments ", "However in most countries the main effort in HAA guns until the mid s was improving existing ones although various new designs were on drawing boards ", " From the early s eight countries developed radar these developments were sufficiently advanced by the late s for development work on sound locating acoustic devices to be generally halted although equipment was retained ", "Furthermore in Britain the volunteer Observer Corps formed in provided a network of observation posts to report hostile aircraft flying over Britain ", "Initially radar was used for airspace surveillance to detect approaching hostile aircraft ", "However the German W rzburg radar was capable of providing data suitable for controlling AA guns and the British AA No Mk GL radar was designed to be used on AA gun positions ", " The Treaty of Versailles prevented Germany having AA weapons and for example the Krupps designers joined Bofors in Sweden ", "Some World War I guns were retained and some covert AA training started in the late s ", "Germany introduced the cm FlaK in and models followed with various improvements but ballistic performance was unchanged ", "In the late s the cm FlaK appeared soon followed by the this was designed primarily for static sites but had a mobile mounting and the unit had V kW generators ", "In design started on the cm FlaK ", " The USSR introduced a new mm M in the early s and an mm M towards the end of the decade ", " Britain had successfully tested a new HAA gun inch in ", "In inch became the preferred solution but it took years to gain funding ", "Production of the QF inch mm began in this gun was used on mobile carriages with the field army and transportable guns on fixed mountings for static positions ", "At the same time the Royal Navy adopted a new inch mm gun in a twin turret which the army adopted in simplified single gun mountings for static positions mostly around ports where naval ammunition was available ", "The performance of the new guns was limited by their standard fuse No with a second running time although a new mechanical time fuse giving seconds was nearing readiness ", "In a Machine Fuse Setter was introduced to eliminate manual fuse setting ", " The US ended World War I with two inch AA guns and improvements were developed throughout the inter war period ", "However in work started on a new mm static mounting AA gun but only a few were produced by the mid s because by this time work had started on the mm AA gun with mobile carriages and static mountings able to engage air sea and ground targets ", "The M version was approved in ", "During the s there was some work on a inch which lapsed but revived in leading to a new gun in ", " While HAA and its associated target acquisition and fire control was the primary focus of AA efforts low level close range targets remained and by the mid s were becoming an issue ", "Until this time the British at RAF insistence continued their use of World War I machine guns and introduced twin MG mountings for AAAD ", "The army was forbidden from considering anything larger than inch ", "However in their trials showed that the minimum effective round was an impact fused lb HE shell ", "The following year they decided to adopt the Bofors mm and a twin barrel Vickers pdr mm on a modified naval mount ", "The air cooled Bofors was vastly superior for land use being much lighter than the water cooled pom pom and UK production of the Bofors mm was licensed ", "The Predictor AA No as the Kerrison Predictor was officially known was introduced with it ", " The mm Bofors had become available in ", "In the late s the Swedish Navy had ordered the development of a mm naval anti aircraft gun from the Bofors company ", "It was light rapid firing and reliable and a mobile version on a four wheel carriage was soon developed ", "Known

following year ", "A redesigned gun cm FlaK entered service in it too had a two wheel carriage ", " However by the mid s the Luftwaffe realised that there was still a coverage gap between cm and cm guns ", "They started development of a cm gun on a four wheel carriage ", " After World War I the US Army started developing a dual role AA ground automatic mm cannon designed by John M Browning ", "It was standardised in as the T AA cannon but trials quickly revealed that it was worthless in the ground role ", "However while the shell was a bit light well under lbs it had a good effective ceiling and fired rounds per minute an AA carriage was developed and it entered service in ", "The Browning mm proved prone to jamming and was eventually replaced in AA units by the Bofors mm ", "The Bofors had attracted attention from the US Navy but none were acquired before ", " Also in the US Army worked on a mobile anti aircraft machine mount on the back of a heavy truck having four calibre

aircraft fire it quickly became clear that guidance would be required for precision ", "However rockets or unrotated projectiles as they were called could be used for anti aircraft barrages ", "A inch

small caliber naval guns could manage to keep enemy aircraft beyond a range where harm might be expected ", "In radio controlled drones became available to the US Navy in quantity allowing a more realistic testing of existing anti aircraft suites against actual flying and manoeuvring targets ", " The results were sobering to an unexpected degree ", "The United States was still emerging from the effects of the Great Depression and funds for the military had been sparse to the degree that of shells used were still powder fused ", " The US Navy found that a significant portion of its shells were duds or low order detonations incomplete detonation of the explosive contained by the shell ", "Virtually every major country involved in combat in World War invested in aircraft development ", "The cost of aircraft research and development was small and the results could be large ", " So rapid was the performance leaps of evolving aircraft that the British HAC s fire control system was obsolete and designing a successor very difficult for the British establishment ", " Electronics would prove to be an enabler for effective anti aircraft systems and both the US and Great Britain had a growing electronics industry ", " In radio controlled drones became available to actually test existing systems in British and American service ", "The results were disappointing by any measure ", "High level manoeuvring drones were virtually immune to shipboard AA systems ", "The US drones could simulate dive bombing which showed the dire need for autocannons ", "Japan introduced powered gliders in as drones but apparently was unable to dive bomb ", " There is no evidence of other powers using drones in this application at all ", "It may have caused a major underestimation of the

against light medium and even early heavy tanks ", "After the Dambusters raid in an entirely new system was developed that was required to knock down any low flying aircraft with a single hit ", "The first attempt to produce such a system used a mm gun but this proved inaccurate and a new mm gun replaced it ", "The system used a centralised control system including both search and targeting radar which calculated the aim point for the guns after considering windage and ballistics and then sent electrical commands to the guns which used hydraulics to point themselves at high speeds ", "Operators simply fed the guns and selected the targets ", "This system modern even by today s standards was in late development when the war ended ", "The British had already arranged licence building of the Bofors mm and introduced these into service ", "These had the power to knock down aircraft of any size yet were light enough to be mobile and easily swung ", "The gun became so important to the British war effort that they even produced a movie The Gun that encouraged workers on the assembly line to work harder ", "The Imperial measurement production drawings the British had developed were supplied to the Americans who produced their own unlicensed copy of the mm at the start of the war moving to licensed production in mid ", "Service trials demonstrated another problem however that ranging and tracking the new high speed targets was almost impossible ", "At short range the apparent target area is relatively large the trajectory is flat and the time of flight is short allowing to correct lead by watching the tracers ", "At long range the aircraft remains in firing range for a long time so the necessary calculations can in theory be done by slide rules though because small errors in distance cause large errors in shell fall height and detonation time exact ranging is crucial ", "For the ranges and speeds that the Bofors worked at neither answer was good enough ", "The solution was automation in the form of a mechanical computer the Kerrison Predictor ", "Operators kept it pointed at the target and the Predictor then calculated the proper aim point automatically and displayed it as a pointer mounted on the gun ", "The gun operators simply followed the pointer and loaded the shells ", "The Kerrison was fairly simple but it pointed the way to future generations that incorporated radar first for ranging and later for tracking ", "Similar predictor systems were introduced by Germany during the war also adding radar ranging as the war progressed ", "A plethora of anti aircraft gun systems of smaller calibre was available to the German Wehrmacht combined forces and among them the origin Flakvierling quadruple mm autocannon based anti aircraft weapon system was one of the most often seen weapons seeing service on both land and sea ", "The similar Allied smaller calibre air defence weapons of the American forces were also quite capable although they receive little attention ", "Their needs could cogently be met with smaller calibre ordnance beyond using the usual singly mounted M caliber machine gun atop a tank s turret as four of the ground used heavy barrel M HB guns were mounted together on the American Maxson firm s M Quadmount weapon as a direct answer to the Flakvierling which were often mounted on the back of a half track to form the Half Track M GMC Anti Aircraft ", "Although of less power than Germany s mm systems the typical four or five combat batteries of an Army AAA battalion were often spread many kilometres apart from each other rapidly attaching and detaching to larger ground combat units to provide welcome defence from enemy aircraft ", "AAA battalions were also used to help suppress ground targets ", "Their larger mm M gun would prove as did the eighty eight to make an excellent anti tank gun as well and was widely used late in the war in this role ", "Also available to the Americans at

from other fighter aircraft designs by higher speeds and shorter operating ranges as well as much reduced ordnance payloads ", "The radar systems use electromagnetic waves to identify the range altitude direction or speed of aircraft and weather formations to provide tactical and operational warning and direction primarily during defensive operations ", "In their functional roles they provide target search threat detection guidance reconnaissance navigation instrumentation and weather reporting support to combat operations ", "An Anti UAV Defence System AUDS is a system for defence against military unmanned aerial vehicles ", "A variety of designs have been developed using lasers net guns and air to air netting signal jamming and hi jacking by means of in flight hacking ", " Anti UAV defence systems have been deployed against ISIL drones during the Battle of Mosul ", " Alternative approaches for dealing with UAVs have included using a shotgun at close range and for smaller drones training eagles to snatch them from the air ", " It is important to keep in mind that this only works on relatively small UAVs and loitering munitions also called suicide drones ", "Larger UCAVs such as the MQ Predator can be and frequently are shot down like manned aircraft of similar sizes and flight profiles ", " Guns are being increasingly pushed into specialist roles such as the Dutch Goalkeeper CIWS which uses the GAU Avenger mm seven barrel Gatling gun for last ditch anti missile and anti aircraft defence ", "Even this formerly front line weapon is currently being replaced by new missile systems such as the RIM Rolling Airframe Missile which is smaller faster and allows for mid flight course correction guidance to ensure a hit ", "To bridge the gap between guns and missiles Russia in particular produces the Kashtan CIWS which uses both guns and missiles for final defense with two six barrelled mm Gsh Gatling guns and eight M surface to air missiles provide for its defensive capabilities ", "Upsetting this development to all missile systems is the current move to stealth aircraft ", "Long range missiles depend on long range detection to provide significant lead ", "Stealth designs cut detection ranges so much that the aircraft is often never even seen and when it is it is often too late for an intercept ", "Systems for detection and tracking of stealthy aircraft are a major problem for anti aircraft development ", "However as stealth technology grows so does anti stealth technology ", "Multiple transmitter radars such as those from bistatic radars and low frequency radars are said to have the capabilities to detect stealth aircraft ", "Advanced forms of thermographic cameras such as those that incorporate QWIPs would be able to optically see a Stealth aircraft regardless of the aircraft s Radar Cross Section RCS ", "In addition Side looking radars High powered optical satellites and sky scanning high aperture high sensitivity radars such as radio telescopes would all be able to narrow down the location of a stealth aircraft under certain parameters ", " The newest SAMs have a claimed ability to be able to detect and engage stealth targets with the most notable being the Russian S which is claimed to be able to detect a target with a metre squared RCS from km away ", " Another potential weapon system for anti aircraft use is the laser ", "Although air planners have imagined lasers in combat since the late s only the most modern laser systems are currently reaching what could be considered experimental usefulness ", "In particular the Tactical High Energy Laser can be used in the anti aircraft and anti missile role ", "ALKA is directed energy weapon DEW system is a Turkish dual electromagnetic laser weapon developed by Roketsan allegedly used to destroy one of GNC s Wing Loong II UAVs if true this would represent the first known time a vehicle mounted combat laser was used to destroy another combat vehicle during genuine wartime conditions ", " The future of projectile based weapons may be found in the railgun ", "Currently tests are underway on developing systems that could create as much damage as a Tomahawk missile but at a fraction of the cost ", "In February the US Navy tested a railgun it fired a shell at miles km per hour using megajoules of energy ", "Its expected performance is over miles km per hour muzzle velocity accurate enough to hit a metre target from nautical miles km away while shooting at shots per minute ", "It is expected to be ready in to ", " These systems while currently designed for static targets would only need the ability to be retargeted to become the next generation of AA system ", "Most Western and Commonwealth militaries integrate air defence purely with the traditional services of the military i e ", "army navy and air force as a separate arm or as part of artillery ", "In the British Army for instance air defence is part of the artillery arm while in the Pakistan Army it was split off from the artillery to form a separate arm of its own in ", "This is in contrast to some largely communist or ex communist countries where not only are there provisions for air defence in the army navy and air force but there are specific branches that deal only with the air defence of territory for example the Soviet PVO Strany ", "The USSR also had a separate strategic rocket force in charge of nuclear intercontinental ballistic missiles ", "Smaller boats and ships typically have machine guns or fast cannons which can often be deadly to low flying aircraft if linked to a radar directed fire control system radar controlled cannon for point defence ", "Some vessels like Aegis equipped destroyers and cruisers are as much a threat to aircraft as any land based air defence system ", "In general naval vessels should be treated with respect by aircraft however the reverse is equally true ", "Carrier battle groups are especially well defended as not only do they typically consist of many vessels with heavy air defence armament but they are also able to launch fighter jets for combat air patrol overhead to intercept incoming airborne threats ", "Nations such as Japan use their SAM equipped vessels to create an outer air defence perimeter and radar picket in the defence of its Home islands and the United States also uses its Aegis equipped ships as part of its Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense System in the defence of the Continental United States ", "Some modern submarines such as the Type submarines of the German Navy are equipped with surface to air missile systems since helicopters and anti submarine warfare aircraft are significant threats ", "The subsurface launched anti air missile was first purposed by US Navy Rear Admiral Charles B Momsen in a article ", " Air defence in naval tactics especially within a carrier group is often built around a system of concentric layers with the aircraft carrier at the centre ", "The outer layer will usually be provided by the carrier s aircraft specifically its AEW C aircraft combined with the CAP ", "If an attacker is able to penetrate this layer then the next layers would come from the surface to air missiles carried by the carrier s escorts the area defence missiles such as the RIM Standard with a range of up to nmi and the point defence missiles like the RIM ESSM with a range of up to nmi ", "Finally virtually every modern warship will be fitted with small calibre guns including a CIWS which is usually a radar controlled Gatling gun of between mm and mm calibre capable of firing several thousand rounds per minute ", " Armies typically have air defence in depth from integral man portable air defense systems MANPADS such as the RBS Stinger and Igla at smaller force levels up to army level missile defence systems such as Angara and Patriot ", "Often the high altitude long range missile systems force aircraft to fly at low level where anti aircraft guns can bring them down ", "As well as the small and large systems for effective air defence there must be intermediate systems ", "These may be deployed at regiment level and consist of platoons of self propelled anti aircraft platforms whether they are self propelled anti aircraft guns SPAAGs integrated air defence systems like Tunguska or all in one surface to air missile platforms like Roland or SA Gecko ", "On a national level the United States Army was atypical in that it was primarily responsible for the missile air defences of the Continental United States with systems such as Project Nike ", "Air defence by air forces is typically provided by fighter jets carrying air to air missiles ", "However most air forces choose to augment airbase defence with surface to air missile systems as they are such valuable targets and subject to attack by enemy aircraft ", "In addition some countries choose to put all air defence responsibilities under the air force ", "Area air defence the air defence of a specific area or location as opposed to point defence have historically been operated by both armies Anti Aircraft Command in the British Army for instance and Air Forces the United States Air Force s CIM Bomarc ", "Area defence systems have medium to long range and can be made up of various other systems and networked into an area defence system in which case it may be made up of several short range systems combined to effectively cover an area ", "An example of area defence is the defence of Saudi Arabia and Israel by MIM Patriot missile batteries during the first Gulf War where the objective was to cover populated areas ", "Most modern air defence systems are fairly mobile ", "Even the larger systems tend to be mounted on trailers and are designed to be fairly quickly broken down or set up ", "In the past this was not always the case ", "Early missile systems were cumbersome and required much infrastructure many could not be moved at all ", "With the diversification of air defence there has been much more emphasis on mobility ", "Most modern systems are usually either self propelled i e ", "guns or missiles are mounted on a truck or tracked chassis or towed ", "Even systems that consist of many components transporter erector launchers radars command posts etc ", "benefit from being mounted on a fleet of vehicles ", "In general a fixed system can be identified attacked and destroyed whereas a mobile system can show up in places where it is not expected ", "Soviet systems especially concentrate on mobility after the lessons learnt in the Vietnam war between the US and Vietnam ", "For more information on this part of the conflict see SA Guideline ", "Israel and the US Air Force in conjunction with the members of NATO have developed significant tactics for air defence suppression ", "Dedicated weapons such as anti radiation missiles and advanced electronics intelligence and electronic countermeasures platforms seek to suppress or negate the effectiveness of an opposing air defence system ", "It is an arms race as better jamming countermeasures and anti radiation weapons are developed so are better SAM systems with ECCM capabilities and the ability to shoot down anti radiation missiles and other munitions aimed at them or the targets they are defending ", "Rocket propelled grenades can be and often are used against hovering helicopters e g by Somali militiamen during the Battle of Mogadishu ", "Firing an RPG at steep angles poses a danger to the user because the backblast from firing reflects off the ground ", "In Somalia militia members sometimes welded a steel plate onto the exhaust end of an RPG s tube to deflect pressure away from the shooter when shooting up at US helicopters ", "RPGs are used in this role only when more effective weapons are not available ", "Another example of using RPGs against helicopters is Operation ANACONDA in March in Afghanistan ", "Taliban Insurgents defending Shah i Kot Valley used RPGs in the direct fire role against landing helicopters ", "Four rangers were killed when their helicopter was shot down by an RPG and SEAL team member Neil C Roberts fell out of his helicopter when it was hit by two RPG ", " In other instances helicopters have been shot down in Afghanistan during a mission in Wardak province ", "One feature that makes RPGs useful in air defence is that they are fused to automatically detonate at m If aimed into the air this causes the warhead to airburst which can release a limited but potentially damaging amount of shrapnel hitting a helicopter landing or taking off ", "For insurgents the most effective method of countering aircraft is to attempt to destroy them on the ground either by penetrating an airbase perimeter and destroying aircraft individually e g ", "the September Camp Bastion raid or finding a position where aircraft can be engaged with indirect fire such as mortars ", "A recent trend emerging during the Syrian Civil War is the use of ATGM against landing helicopters ", " "]},
