pronunciation being that one has an aspirated sound where the other has an unaspirated one ", "Part of the phonological study of a language therefore involves looking at data phonetic transcriptions

contrasts which are phonemic in a language can change over time ", "At one time f and v two sounds that have the same place and manner of articulation and differ in voicing only were allophones of the same phoneme in English but later came to belong to separate phonemes ", "This is one of the main factors of historical change of languages as described in historical linguistics ", "The findings and insights of speech perception and articulation research complicate the traditional and somewhat intuitive idea of interchangeable allophones being perceived as the same phoneme ", "First interchanged allophones of the same phoneme can result in unrecognizable words ", "Second actual speech even at a word level is highly co articulated so it is problematic to expect to be able to splice words into simple segments without affecting speech perception ", "Different linguists therefore take different approaches to the problem of assigning sounds to phonemes ", "For example they differ in the extent to which they require allophones to be phonetically similar ", "There are also differing ideas as to whether this grouping of sounds is purely a tool for linguistic analysis or reflects an actual process in the way the human brain processes a language ", "Since the early s theoretical linguists have moved away from the traditional concept of a phoneme preferring to consider basic units at a more abstract level as a component of morphemes these units can be called morphophonemes and analysis using this approach is called morphophonology ", "In addition to the minimal units that can serve the purpose of differentiating meaning the phonemes phonology studies how sounds alternate or replace one another in different forms of the same morpheme allomorphs as well as for example syllable structure stress feature geometry tone and intonation ", "Phonology also includes topics such as phonotactics the phonological constraints on what sounds can appear in what positions in a given language and phonological alternation how the pronunciation of a sound changes through the application of phonological rules sometimes in a given order that can be feeding or bleeding as well as prosody the study of suprasegmentals and topics such as stress and intonation ", "The principles of phonological analysis can be applied independently of modality because they are designed to serve as

images as familiar and stimulation at Hz caused novel images to be partially treated as familiar ", " In particular stimulation at Hz led to animals looking at a familiar image for longer periods as they would for an unfamiliar one though it did not lead to the same exploration behavior normally associated with novelty ", "Recent studies on lesions in the area concluded that rats with a damaged perirhinal cortex were still more interested in exploring when novel objects were present but seemed unable to tell novel objects from familiar ones they examined both equally ", "Thus other brain regions are involved with noticing unfamiliarity while the perirhinal cortex is needed to associate the feeling with a specific source ", " Sexual stimulation is any stimulus including bodily contact that leads to enhances and maintains sexual arousal possibly even leading to orgasm ", "Distinct from the general sense of touch sexual stimulation is strongly tied to hormonal activity and chemical triggers in the body ", "Although sexual arousal may arise without physical stimulation achieving orgasm usually requires physical sexual stimulation stimulation of the Krause Finger corpuscles found in erogenous zones of the body ", "Other senses enable perception of body balance acceleration gravity position of body parts temperature and pain ", "They can also enable perception of internal senses such as suffocation gag reflex abdominal distension fullness of rectum and urinary bladder and sensations felt in the throat and lungs ", "In the case of visual perception some people can see the percept shift in their mind s eye ", " Others who are not picture thinkers may not necessarily perceive the shape shifting as their world changes ", "This esemplastic nature has been demonstrated by an experiment that showed that ambiguous images have multiple interpretations on the perceptual level ", "The confusing ambiguity of perception is exploited in human technologies such as camouflage and biological mimicry ", "For example the wings of European peacock butterflies bear eyespots that birds respond to as though they were the eyes of a dangerous predator ", "There is also evidence that the brain in some ways operates on a slight delay in order to allow nerve impulses from distant parts of the body to be integrated into simultaneous signals ", " Perception is one of the oldest fields in psychology ", "The oldest quantitative laws in psychology are Weber s law which states that the smallest noticeable difference in stimulus intensity is proportional to the intensity of the reference and Fechner s law which quantifies the relationship between the intensity of the physical stimulus and its perceptual counterpart e g testing how much darker a computer screen can get before the viewer actually notices ", "The study of perception gave rise to the Gestalt School of Psychology with an emphasis on holistic approach ", "A sensory system is a part of the nervous system responsible for processing sensory information ", "A sensory system consists of sensory receptors neural pathways and parts of the brain involved in sensory perception ", "Commonly recognized sensory systems are those for vision hearing somatic sensation touch taste and olfaction smell as listed above ", "It has been suggested that the immune system is an overlooked sensory modality ", " In short senses are transducers from the physical world to the realm of the mind ", "The receptive field is the specific part of the world to which a receptor organ and receptor cells respond ", "For instance the part of the world an eye can see is its receptive field the light that each rod or cone can see is its receptive field ", " Receptive fields have been identified for the visual system auditory system and somatosensory system so far ", "Research attention is currently focused not only on external perception processes but also to interoception considered as the process of receiving accessing and appraising internal bodily signals ", "Maintaining desired physiological states is critical for an organism s well being and survival ", "Interoception is an iterative process requiring the interplay between perception of body states and awareness of these states to generate proper self regulation ", "Afferent sensory signals continuously interact with higher order cognitive representations of goals history and environment shaping emotional experience and motivating regulatory behavior ", " Perceptual constancy is the ability of perceptual systems to recognize the same object from widely varying sensory inputs ", " For example individual people can be recognized from views such as frontal and profile which form very different shapes on the retina ", "A coin looked at face on makes a circular image on the retina but when held at angle it makes an elliptical image ", " In normal perception these are recognized as a single three dimensional object ", "Without this correction process an animal approaching from the distance would appear to gain in size ", " One kind of perceptual constancy is color constancy for example a white piece of paper can be recognized as such under different colors and intensities of light ", " Another example is roughness constancy when a hand is drawn quickly across a surface the touch nerves are stimulated more intensely ", "The brain compensates for this so the speed of contact does not affect the perceived roughness ", " Other constancies include melody odor brightness and words ", " These constancies are not always total but the variation in the percept is much less than the variation in the physical stimulus ", " The perceptual systems of the brain achieve perceptual constancy in a variety of ways each specialized for the kind of information being processed with phonemic restoration as a notable example from hearing The principles of grouping or Gestalt laws of grouping are a set of principles in psychology first proposed by Gestalt psychologists to explain how humans naturally perceive objects as organized patterns and objects ", "Gestalt psychologists argued that these principles exist because the mind has an innate disposition to perceive patterns in the stimulus based on certain rules ", "These principles are organized into six categories Later research has identified additional grouping principles ", " A common finding across many different kinds of perception is that the perceived qualities of an object can be affected by the qualities of context ", "If one object is extreme on some dimension then neighboring objects are perceived as further away from that extreme ", " Simultaneous contrast effect is the term used when stimuli are presented at the same time whereas successive contrast applies when stimuli are presented one after another ", " The contrast effect was noted by the th Century philosopher John Locke who observed that lukewarm water can feel hot or cold depending on whether the hand touching it was previously in hot or cold water ", " In the early th Century Wilhelm Wundt identified contrast as a fundamental principle of perception and since then the effect has been confirmed in many different areas ", " These effects shape not only visual qualities like color and brightness but other kinds of perception including how heavy an object feels ", " One experiment found that thinking of the name Hitler led to subjects rating a person as more hostile ", " Whether a piece of music is perceived as good or bad can depend on whether the music heard before it was pleasant or unpleasant ", " For the effect to work the objects being compared need to be similar to each other a television reporter can seem smaller when interviewing a tall basketball player but not when standing next to a tall building ", " In the brain brightness contrast exerts effects on both neuronal firing rates and neuronal synchrony ", " Cognitive theories of perception assume there is a poverty of stimulus ", "This is the claim that sensations by themselves are unable to provide a unique description of the world ", " Sensations require enriching which is the role of the mental model ", "The perceptual ecology approach was introduced by James J Gibson who rejected the assumption of a poverty of stimulus and the idea that perception is based upon sensations ", "Instead Gibson investigated what information is actually presented to the perceptual systems ", "His theory assumes the existence of stable unbounded and permanent stimulus information in the ambient optic array ", "And it supposes that the visual system can explore and detect this information ", "The theory is information based not sensation based ", " He and the psychologists who work within this paradigm detailed how the world could be specified to a mobile exploring organism via the lawful projection of information about the world into energy arrays ", " Specification would be a mapping of some aspect of the world into a perceptual array ", "Given such a mapping no enrichment is required and perception is direct ", " From Gibson s early work derived an ecological understanding of perception known as perception in action which argues that perception is a requisite property of animate action ", "It posits that without perception action would be unguided and without action perception would serve no purpose ", "Animate actions require both perception and motion which can be described as two sides of the same coin the coin is action ", "Gibson works from the assumption that singular entities which he calls invariants already exist in the real world and that all that the perception process does is home in upon them ", "The constructivist view held by such philosophers as Ernst von Glasersfeld regards the continual adjustment of perception and action to the external input as precisely what constitutes the entity which is therefore far from being invariant ", " Glasersfeld considers an invariant as a target to be homed in upon and a pragmatic necessity to allow an initial measure of understanding to be established prior to the updating that a statement aims to achieve ", "The invariant does not and need not represent an actuality ", "Glasersfeld describes it as extremely unlikely that what is desired or feared by an organism will never suffer change as time goes on ", "This social constructionist theory thus allows for a needful evolutionary adjustment ", " A mathematical theory of perception in action has been devised and investigated in many forms of controlled movement and has been described in many different species of organism using the General Tau Theory ", "According to this theory tau information or time to goal information is the fundamental percept in perception ", "Many philosophers such as Jerry Fodor write that the purpose of perception is knowledge ", "However evolutionary psychologists hold that the primary purpose of perception is to guide action ", " They give the example of depth perception which seems to have evolved not to aid in knowing the distances to other objects but rather to aid movement ", " Evolutionary psychologists argue that animals ranging from fiddler crabs to humans use eyesight for collision avoidance suggesting that vision is basically for directing action not providing knowledge ", " Neuropsychologists showed that perception systems evolved along the specifics of animals activities ", "This explains why bats and worms can perceive different frequency of auditory and visual systems than for example humans ", "Building and maintaining sense organs is metabolically expensive ", "More than half the brain is devoted to processing sensory information and the brain itself consumes roughly one fourth of one s metabolic resources ", "Thus such organs evolve only when they provide exceptional benefits to an organism s fitness ", " Scientists who study perception and sensation have long understood the human senses as adaptations ", " Depth perception consists of processing over half a dozen visual cues each of which is based on a regularity of the physical world ", " Vision evolved to respond to the narrow range of electromagnetic energy that is plentiful and that does not pass through objects ", " Sound waves provide useful information about the sources of and distances to objects with larger animals making and hearing lower frequency sounds and smaller animals making and hearing higher frequency sounds ", " Taste and smell respond to chemicals in the environment that were significant for fitness in the environment of evolutionary adaptedness ", " The sense of touch is actually many senses including pressure heat cold tickle and pain ", " Pain while unpleasant is adaptive ", " An important adaptation for senses is range shifting by which the organism becomes temporarily more or less sensitive to sensation ", " For example one s eyes automatically adjust to dim or bright ambient light ", " Sensory abilities of different organisms often co evolve as is the case with the hearing of echolocating bats and that of the moths that have evolved to respond to the sounds that the bats make ", " Evolutionary psychologists claim that perception demonstrates the principle of modularity with specialized mechanisms handling particular perception tasks ", " For example people with damage to a particular part of the brain are not able to recognize faces prosopagnosia ", " Evolutionary psychology suggests that this indicates a so called face reading module ", " The theory of closed loop perception proposes dynamic motor sensory closed loop process in which information flows through the environment and the brain in continuous loops ", " Anne Treisman s feature integration theory FIT attempts to explain how characteristics of a stimulus such as physical location in space motion color and shape are merged to form one percept despite each of these characteristics activating separate areas of the cortex ", "FIT explains this through a two part system of perception involving the preattentive and focused attention stages ", " The preattentive stage of perception is largely unconscious and analyzes an object by breaking it down into its basic features such as the specific color geometric shape motion depth individual lines and many others ", " Studies have shown that when small groups of objects with different features e g red triangle blue circle are briefly flashed in front of human participants many individuals later report seeing shapes made up of the combined features of two different stimuli thereby referred to as illusory conjunctions ", " The unconnected features described in the preattentive stage are combined into the objects one normally sees during the focused attention stage ", " The focused attention stage is based heavily around the idea of attention in perception and binds the features together onto specific objects at specific spatial locations see the binding problem ", " With experience organisms can learn to make finer perceptual distinctions and learn new kinds of categorization ", "Wine tasting the reading of X ray images and music appreciation are applications of this process in the human sphere ", "Research has focused on the relation of this to other kinds of learning and whether it takes place in peripheral sensory systems or in the brain s processing of sense information ", " Empirical research show that specific practices such as yoga mindfulness Tai Chi meditation Daoshi and other mind body disciplines can modify human perceptual modality ", "Specifically these practices enable perception skills to switch from the external exteroceptive field towards a higher ability to focus on internal signals proprioception ", "Also when asked to provide verticality judgments highly self transcendent yoga practitioners were significantly less influenced by a misleading visual context ", "Increasing self transcendence may enable yoga practitioners to optimize verticality judgment tasks by relying more on internal vestibular and proprioceptive signals coming from their own body rather than on exteroceptive visual cues ", " Past actions and events that transpire right before an encounter or any form of stimulation have a strong degree of influence on how sensory stimuli are processed and perceived ", "On a basic level the information our senses receive is often ambiguous and incomplete ", "However they are grouped together in order for us to be able to understand the physical world around us ", "But it is these various forms of stimulation combined with our previous knowledge and experience that allows us to create our overall perception ", "For example when engaging in conversation we attempt to understand their message and words by not only paying attention to what we hear through our ears but also from the previous shapes we have seen our mouths make ", "Another example would be if we had a similar topic come up in another conversation we would use our previous knowledge to guess the direction the conversation is headed in ", " A perceptual set also called perceptual expectancy or simply set is a predisposition to perceive things in a certain way ", " It is an example of how perception can be shaped by top down processes such as drives and expectations ", " Perceptual sets occur in all the different senses ", " They can be long term such as a special sensitivity to hearing one s own name in a crowded room or short term as in the ease with which hungry people notice the smell of food ", " A simple demonstration of the effect involved very brief presentations of non words such as sael ", "Subjects who were told to expect words about animals read it as seal but others who were expecting boat related words read it as sail ", " Sets can be created by motivation and so can result in people interpreting ambiguous figures so that they see what they want to see ", " For instance how someone perceives what unfolds during a sports game can be biased if they strongly support one of the teams ", " In one experiment students were allocated to pleasant or unpleasant tasks by a computer ", "They were told that either a number or a letter would flash on the screen to say whether they were going to taste an orange juice drink or an unpleasant tasting health drink ", "In fact an ambiguous figure was flashed on screen which could either be read as the letter B or the number ", "When the letters were associated with the pleasant task subjects were more likely to perceive a letter B and when letters were associated with the unpleasant task they tended to perceive a number ", " Perceptual set has been demonstrated in many social contexts ", "When someone has a reputation for being funny an audience is more likely to find them amusing ", " Individual s perceptual sets reflect their own personality traits ", "For example people with an aggressive personality are quicker to correctly identify aggressive words or situations ", " One classic psychological experiment showed slower reaction times and less accurate answers when a deck of playing cards reversed the color of the suit symbol for some cards e g ", "red spades and black hearts ", " Philosopher Andy Clark explains that perception although it occurs quickly is not simply a bottom up process where minute details are put together to form larger wholes ", "Instead our brains use what he calls predictive coding ", "It starts with very broad constraints and expectations for the state of the world and as expectations are met it makes more detailed predictions errors lead to new predictions or learning processes ", "Clark says this research has various implications not only can there be no completely unbiased unfiltered perception but this means that there is a great deal of feedback between perception and expectation perceptual experiences often shape our beliefs but those perceptions were based on existing beliefs ", " Indeed predictive coding provides an account where this type of feedback assists in stabilizing our inference making process about the physical world such as with perceptual constancy examples ", "Embodied cognition challenges the idea of perception as internal representations resulting from a passive reception of incomplete sensory inputs coming from the outside world ", "According to O Regan the major issue with this perspective is that it leaves the subjective character of perception unexplained ", " Thus perception is understood as an active process conducted by perceiving and engaged agents perceivers ", "Furthermore perception is influenced by agents motives and expectations their bodily states and the interaction between the agent s body and the environment around it ", " "]},

with this disorder will direct attention and movements to the ipsilesional side and neglect stimuli in the contralesional side despite having preserved visual fields ", "The result of all of this is an increased sensitivity of visual performance in the unaffected side ", " The patient shows an affinity to the ipsilesional side being unable to disengage attention from that side ", " Spatial

supported by neglect in dreams Figliozzi et al ", " The study was run on a neglect patient by tracking his eye movements while he slept during the REM cycle ", "Results showed that the majority of the

egocentric neglect is found in patients who neglect their own body or personal space ", " These patients tend to neglect the opposite side of their lesion based on the midline of the body head or retina ", " For example in a gap detection test subjects with egocentric hemispatial neglect on the right side often make errors on the far right side of the page as they are neglecting the space in

left and right sides of the page while ignoring those across the top or bottom ", " citation needed In a recent study researchers asked patients with left neglect to project their midline with a neon bulb and found that they tended to point it straight ahead but position it rightward of their true midline ", "This shift may account for the success of therapeutic prism glasses which shift left visual space toward the right ", "By shifting visual input they seem to correct the mind s sense of midline ", "The result is not only the amelioration of visual neglect but also of tactile motor and even representational neglect ", "An important question in studies of neglect has been left of what ", "That is to say what frame of reference does a subject adopt when neglecting the left half of his or her visual auditory or tactile field ", "The answer has proven complex ", "It turns out that subjects may neglect objects to the left of their own midline egocentric neglect or may instead see all the objects in a room but neglect the left half of each individual object allocentric neglect ", " These two broad categories may be further subdivided ", "Patients with egocentric neglect may ignore the stimuli leftward of their trunks their heads or their retinae ", " Those with allocentric neglect may neglect the true left of a presented object or may first correct in their mind s eye a slanted or inverted object and then neglect the side then interpreted as being on the left ", " So for example if patients are presented with an upside down photograph of a face they may mentally flip the object right side up and then neglect the left side of the adjusted image ", "In another example if patients are presented with a barbell patients will more significantly neglect the left side of the barbell as expected with right temporal lobe lesion ", "If the barbell is rotated such that the left side is now on the right side patients will more significantly neglect the left side of the object

Western Hemisphere despite their inverted placement onto the right side of the map ", "Various neuropsychological research studies have considered the role of frame of reference in hemispatial neglect offering new evidence to support both allocentric and egocentric neglect ", "To begin one study conducted by Dongyun Li Hans Otto Karnath and Christopher Rorden examined whether allocentric neglect varies with egocentric position ", "This experimental design consisted of testing eleven right hemispheric stroke patients ", "Five of these patients showed spatial neglect on their contralesional side while the remaining six patients showed no spatial neglect ", " During the study the patients were presented with two arrays of seven triangles ", "The first array ran from southwest to northeast SW NE and the second array ran from southeast to northwest SE NW ", "In a portion of the experimental trials the middle triangle in the array contained a gap along one side ", "Participants were tested on their ability to perceive the presence of this gap and were instructed to press one response button if the gap was present and a second response button if the gap was absent ", " To test the neglect frame of reference the two different arrays were carefully situated so that gap in the triangle fell on opposite sides of the allocentric field ", "In the SW NE array the gap in the triangle fell on the allocentric right of the object centered axis along which the triangle pointed ", "In the SE NW configuration the gap in the triangle fell on the allocentric left of the object centered axis ", " Furthermore varying the position of the arrays with respect to the participant s trunk midline was used to test egocentric neglect ", "The arrays were therefore presented at i e ", "in line with the participant s trunk midline at left and at right ", " Ultimately varying the position of the array within the testing visual field allowed for the simultaneous measurement of egocentric neglect and allocentric neglect ", "The results of this experimental design showed that the spatial neglect patients performed more poorly for the allocentric left side of the triangle as well as for objects presented on the egocentric left side of the body ", " Furthermore the poor accuracy for detecting features of the object on the left side of the object s axis was more severe when the objects were presented on the contralesional side of the body ", "Thus these findings illustrate that both allocentric and egocentric biases are present simultaneously and that egocentric information can influence the severity of allocentric neglect ", " A second study conducted by Moscovitch and Behrmann investigated the reference frame of neglect with respect to the somatosensory system ", "Eleven patients with parietal lobe lesions and subsequent hemispatial neglect were analyzed during this experiment ", " A double simultaneous stimulation procedure was utilized during which the patients were touched lightly and simultaneously on the left and right side of the wrist of one hand ", "The patients were tested both with their palms facing down and with their palms facing up ", " This experimental condition allowed the scientists to determine whether neglect in the somatosensory system occurs with respect to the sensory receptor surface egocentric or with respect to a higher order spatial frame of reference allocentric ", "The results of this experiment showed the hemispatial neglect patients neglected somatosensory stimuli on the contralesional side of space regardless of hand orientation ", " These findings suggest that within the somatosensory system stimuli are neglected with respect to the allocentric spatial frame of reference in addition to an egocentric sensory frame of reference ", " Ultimately the discoveries made by these experiments indicate that hemispatial neglect occurs with respect to multiple simultaneously derived frames of reference which dictate the nature and extent of neglect within the visual auditory and tactile fields ", "Treatment consists of finding ways to bring the patient s attention toward the left usually done incrementally by going just a few degrees past midline and progressing from there ", "Rehabilitation of neglect is often carried out by neuropsychologists occupational therapists speech language pathologists neurologic music therapists physical therapists optometrists and orthoptists ", "Forms of treatment that have been tested with variable reports of success include prismatic adaptation where a prism lens is worn

been used placing a patch over the good eye ", "Pharmaceutical treatments have mostly focused on dopaminergic therapies such as bromocriptine levodopa and amphetamines though these tests have had mixed results helping in some cases and accentuating hemispatial neglect in others ", "Caloric vestibular stimulation CVS has been shown to bring about a brief remission in some cases ", " however this technique has been known to elicit unpleasant side effects such as nystagmus vertigo and vomiting ", " A study done by Schindler and colleagues examined the use of neck muscle vibration on the contralesional posterior neck muscles to induce diversion of gaze from the subjective straight ahead ", "Subjects received consecutive treatment sessions and were evaluated on different aspects of the neglect disorder including perception of midline and scanning deficits ", "The study found that there is evidence that neck muscle stimulation may work especially if combined with visual scanning techniques ", "The improvement was evident months after the completion of treatment ", " Other areas of emerging treatment options include the use of prisms visual scanning training mental imagery training video feedback training trunk rotation galvanic vestibular stimulation GVS transcranial magnetic stimulation TMS and transcranial direct current stimulation tDCS ", "Of these emerging treatment options the most studied intervention is prism adaptation and there is evidence of relatively long term functional gains from comparatively short term usage ", "However all of these treatment interventions particularly the stimulation techniques are relatively new and randomised controlled trial evidence is still limited ", "Further research is mandatory in this field of research in order to provide more support in evidence based practice ", " In a review article by Pierce Buxbaum they concluded that the evidence for Hemispheric Activation Approaches which focuses on moving the limb on the side of the neglect has conflicting evidence in the literature ", " The authors note that a possible limitation in this approach is the requirement for the patients to actively move the neglected limb which may not be possible for many patients ", "Constraint Induced Therapy CIT appears to be an effective long term treatment for improving neglect in various studies ", "However the use of CIT is limited to patients who have active control of wrist and hand extension ", "Prism Glasses Hemispatial Glasses and Eye Patching have all appear to be effective in improving performance on neglect tests ", "Caloric Stimulation treatment appears to be effective in improving neglect however the effects are generally short term ", "The review also suggests that Optokinetic

corresponding matrix of coefficients ", "This method can also be used to compute the rank of a matrix the determinant of a square matrix and the inverse of an invertible matrix ", "The method is named after Carl Friedrich Gauss although some special cases of the method albeit presented without proof were known to Chinese mathematicians as early as circa AD ", " To perform row reduction on a matrix one uses a sequence of elementary row operations to modify the matrix until the lower left hand corner of the matrix is filled with zeros as much as possible ", "There are three types of elementary row operations Using these operations a matrix can always be transformed into an upper triangular matrix and in fact one that is in row echelon form ", "Once all of the leading coefficients the leftmost nonzero entry in each row are and every column containing a leading coefficient has zeros elsewhere the matrix is said to be in reduced row echelon form ", "This final form is unique in other words it is independent of the sequence of row operations used ", "For example in the following sequence of row operations where two elementary operations on different rows are done at the first and third steps the third and fourth matrices are the ones in row echelon form and the final matrix is the unique reduced row echelon form ", "Using row operations to convert a matrix into reduced row echelon form is sometimes called Gauss Jordan elimination ", "In this case the term Gaussian elimination refers to the process until it has reached its upper triangular or unreduced row echelon form ", "For computational reasons when solving systems of linear equations it is sometimes preferable to stop row operations before the matrix is completely reduced ", "The process of row reduction makes use of elementary row operations and can be divided into two parts ", "The first part sometimes called forward elimination reduces a given system to row echelon form from which one can tell whether there are no solutions a unique solution or infinitely many solutions ", "The second part sometimes called back substitution continues to use row operations until the solution is found in other words it puts the matrix into reduced row echelon form ", "Another point of view which turns out to be very useful to analyze the algorithm is that row reduction produces a matrix decomposition of the original matrix ", "The elementary row operations may be viewed as the multiplication on the left of the original matrix by elementary matrices ", "Alternatively a sequence of elementary operations that reduces a single row may be viewed as multiplication by a Frobenius matrix ", "Then the first part of the algorithm computes an LU decomposition while the second part writes the original matrix as the product of a uniquely determined invertible matrix and a uniquely determined reduced row echelon matrix ", "There are three types of elementary row operations which may be performed on the rows of a matrix If the matrix is associated to a system of linear equations then these operations do not change the solution set ", "Therefore if one s goal is to solve a system of linear equations then using these row operations could make the problem easier ", "For each row in a matrix if the row does not consist of only zeros then the leftmost nonzero entry is called the leading coefficient or pivot of that row ", "So if two leading coefficients are in the same column then a row operation of type could be used to make one of those coefficients zero ", "Then by using the row swapping operation one can always order the rows so that for every non zero row the leading coefficient is to the right of the leading coefficient of the row above ", "If this is the case then matrix is said to be in row echelon form ", "So the lower left part of the matrix contains only zeros and all of the zero rows are below the non zero rows ", "The word echelon is used here because one can roughly think of the rows being ranked by their size with the largest being at the top and the smallest being at the bottom ", "For example the following matrix is in row echelon form and its leading coefficients are shown in red It is in echelon form because the zero row is at the bottom and the leading coefficient of the second row in the third column is to the right of the leading coefficient of the first row in the second column ", "A matrix is said to be in reduced row echelon form if furthermore all of the leading coefficients are equal to which can be achieved by using the elementary row operation of type and in every column containing a leading coefficient all of the other entries in that column are zero which can be achieved by using elementary row operations of type ", "Suppose the goal is to find and describe the set of solutions to the following system of linear equations The table below is the row reduction process applied simultaneously to the system of equations and its associated augmented matrix ", "In practice one does not usually deal with the systems in terms of equations but instead makes use of the augmented matrix which is more suitable for computer manipulations ", "The row reduction procedure may be summarized as follows eliminate x from all equations below L and then eliminate y from all equations below L ", "This will put the system into triangular form ", "Then using back substitution each unknown can be solved for ", "The second column describes which row operations have just been performed ", "So for the first step the x is eliminated from L by adding mw parser output sfrac white space nowrap mw parser output sfrac tion mw parser output sfrac tion display inline block vertical align em font size text align center mw

overflow hidden padding position absolute width px L to L ", "Next x is eliminated from L by adding L to L ", "These row operations are labelled in the table asOnce y is also eliminated from the third row the result is a system of linear equations in triangular form and so the first part of the algorithm is complete ", "From a computational point of view it is faster to solve the variables in reverse order a process known as back substitution ", "One sees the solution is z y and x ", "So there is a unique solution to the original system of equations ", "Instead of stopping once the matrix is in echelon form one could continue until the matrix is in reduced row echelon form as it is done in the table ", "The process of row reducing until the matrix is reduced is sometimes referred to as Gauss Jordan elimination to distinguish it from stopping after reaching echelon form ", "The method of Gaussian elimination appears albeit without proof in the Chinese mathematical text Chapter Eight Rectangular Arrays of The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art ", "Its use is illustrated in eighteen problems with two to five equations ", "The first reference to the book by this title is dated to AD but parts of it were written as early as approximately BC ", " It was commented on by Liu Hui in the rd century ", "The method in Europe stems from the notes of Isaac Newton ", " In he wrote that all the algebra books known to him lacked a lesson for solving simultaneous equations which Newton then supplied ", "Cambridge University eventually published the notes as Arithmetica Universalis in long after Newton had left academic life ", "The notes were widely imitated which made what is now called Gaussian elimination a standard lesson in algebra textbooks by the end of the th century ", "Carl Friedrich Gauss in devised a notation for symmetric elimination that was adopted in the th century by professional hand computers to solve the normal equations of least squares problems ", " The algorithm that is taught in high school was named for Gauss only in the s as a result of confusion over the history of the subject ", " Some authors use the term Gaussian elimination to refer only to the procedure until the matrix is in echelon form and use the term Gauss Jordan elimination to refer to the procedure which ends in reduced echelon form ", "The name is used because it is a variation of Gaussian elimination as described by Wilhelm Jordan in ", "However the method also appears in an article by Clasen published in the same year ", "Jordan and Clasen probably discovered Gauss Jordan elimination independently ", " Historically the first application of the row reduction method is for solving systems of linear equations ", "Below are some other important applications of the algorithm ", "To explain how Gaussian elimination allows the computation of the determinant of a square matrix we have to recall how the elementary row operations change the determinant If Gaussian elimination applied to a square matrix A produces a row echelon matrix B let d be the product of the scalars by which the determinant has been multiplied using the above rules ", "Then the determinant of A is the quotient by d of the product of the elements of the diagonal of B Computationally for an n n matrix this method needs only O n arithmetic operations while using Leibniz formula for determinants requires O n ", "operations number of summands in the formula andrecursive Laplace expansion requires O n operations number of sub determinants to compute if none is computed twice ", "Even on the fastest computers these two methods are impractical or almost impracticable for n above ", " displaystyle A variant of Gaussian elimination called Gauss Jordan elimination can be used for finding the inverse of a matrix if it exists ", "If A is an n n square matrix then one can use row reduction to compute its inverse matrix if it exists ", "First the n n identity matrix is augmented to the right of A forming an n n block matrix A I ", "Now through application of elementary row operations find the reduced echelon form of this n n matrix ", "The matrix A is invertible if and only if the left block can be reduced to the identity matrix I in this case the right block of the final matrix is A ", "If the algorithm is unable to reduce the left block to I then A is not invertible ", "For example consider the following matrix To find the inverse of this matrix one takes the following matrix augmented by the identity and row reduces it as a matrix By performing row operations one can check that the reduced row echelon form of this augmented matrix isOne can think of each row operation as the left product by an elementary matrix ", "Denoting by B the product of these elementary matrices we showed on the left that BA I and therefore B A ", "On the right we kept a record of BI B which we know is the inverse desired ", "This procedure for finding the inverse works for square matrices of any size ", "The Gaussian elimination algorithm can be applied to any m n matrix A ", "In this way for example some matrices can be transformed to a matrix that has a row echelon form likewhere the stars are arbitrary entries and a b c d e are nonzero entries ", "This echelon matrix T contains a wealth of information about A the rank of A is since there are nonzero rows in T the vector space spanned by the columns of A has a basis consisting of its columns and the columns with a b c d e in T and the stars show how the other columns of A can be written as linear combinations of the basis columns ", "This is a consequence of the distributivity of the dot product in the expression of a linear map as a matrix ", "All of this applies also to the reduced row echelon form which is a particular row echelon format ", "The number of arithmetic operations required to perform row reduction is one way of measuring the algorithm s computational efficiency ", "For example to solve a system of n equations for n unknowns by performing row operations on the matrix until it is in echelon form and then solving for each unknown in reverse order requires n n divisions n n n multiplications and n n n subtractions for a total of approximately n operations ", "Thus it has a time complexity of O n ", "This complexity is a good measure of the time needed for the whole computation when the time for each arithmetic operation is approximately constant ", "This is the case when the coefficients are represented by floating point numbers or when they belong to a finite field ", "If the coefficients are integers or rational numbers exactly represented the intermediate entries can grow exponentially large so the bit complexity is exponential ", " However there is a variant of Gaussian elimination called the Bareiss algorithm that avoids this exponential growth of the intermediate entries and with the same arithmetic complexity of O n has a bit complexity of O n ", "This algorithm can be used on a computer for systems with thousands of equations and unknowns ", "However the cost becomes prohibitive for systems with millions of equations ", "These large systems are generally solved using iterative methods ", "Specific methods exist for systems whose coefficients follow a regular pattern see system of linear equations ", "To put an n n matrix into reduced echelon form by row operations one needs n arithmetic operations which is approximately more computation steps ", " One possible problem is numerical instability caused by the possibility of dividing by very small numbers ", "If for example the leading coefficient of one of the rows is very close to zero then to row reduce the matrix one would need to divide by that number ", "This means that any error existed for the number that was close to zero would be amplified ", "Gaussian elimination is numerically stable for diagonally dominant or positive definite matrices ", "For general matrices Gaussian elimination is usually considered to be stable when using partial pivoting even though there are examples of stable matrices for which it is unstable ", " Gaussian elimination can be performed over any field not just the real numbers ", "Buchberger s algorithm is a generalization of Gaussian elimination to systems of polynomial equations ", "This generalization depends heavily on the notion of a monomial order ", "The choice of an ordering on the variables is already implicit in Gaussian elimination manifesting as the choice to work from left to right when selecting pivot positions ", "Computing the rank of a tensor of order greater than is NP hard ", " Therefore if P NP there cannot be a polynomial time analog of Gaussian elimination for higher order tensors matrices are array representations of order tensors ", "As explained above Gaussian elimination transforms a given m n matrix A into a matrix in row echelon form ", "In the following pseudocode A i j denotes the entry of the matrix A in row i and column j with the indices starting from ", "The transformation is performed in place meaning that the original matrix is lost for being eventually replaced by its row echelon form ", "This algorithm differs slightly from the one discussed earlier by choosing a pivot with largest absolute value ", "Such a partial pivoting may be required if at the pivot place the entry of the matrix is zero ", "In any case choosing the largest possible absolute value of the pivot improves the numerical stability of the algorithm when floating point is used for representing numbers ", "Upon completion of this procedure the matrix will be in row echelon form and the corresponding system may be solved by back substitution "]},

representing Flint demanded that the state refund the million to the city ", "Ananich also requested further emergency funding from the state and long term funding to address the effects of the lead contamination ", " On March Michigan declared that returning to the Detroit water system must be approved by the state ", "When approved the city was granted an emergency loan of million ", " On September Flint officials announced that the city will continue to use Detroit water until a new stretch of pipeline is constructed and the Flint River is tested and treated by the KWA ", " From August to November median water lead levels began to go down again depending on the type of water service pipes each home had ", "In homes with copper pipes the median water lead level dropped from micrograms per liter g L to g L galvanized steel service lines dropped from a median water lead level of g L to g L and lead service lines dropped from a median water lead level of g L to g L ", " g L is equivalent to part per billion ", " On December the MDEQ reported that more than percent of water samples in Flint residencies were below the EPA lead threshold of ppb ", " On March the Genesee County Water and Waste Services Advisory Board voted to construct a new pipeline it would be a mile km inch cm connector to the KWA pipeline ", "The pipeline would allow the treatment of raw Lake Huron water so the city of Flint could continue to buy pre treated water from the Great Lakes Water Authority ", "The million project will allow Flint to remain a customer of the GLWA until at least ", " Lead levels tested by the water utility never reached the EPA action level of ppb lead during the crisis ", " In January a public meeting was held where citizens complained about the bad water ", " Residents complained about the taste smell and appearance of the water for months before a Flint physician found elevated blood lead levels in the children of Flint ", "During that time period MDEQ had insisted the water was safe to drink ", " A study by Virginia Tech researchers see section below determined that the river water which due to higher chloride concentration is more corrosive than the lake water was leaching lead from aging pipes ", " Mozhgan Savabieasfahani an environmental toxicologist based in Ann Arbor said this level of lead exposure is comparable with what the Iraqi people have experienced since the U S occupation in ", " While the local outcry about Flint water quality was growing in early Flint water officials filed papers with state regulators purporting to show that tests at Flint s water treatment plant had detected no lead and testing in homes had registered lead at acceptable levels ", " The documents falsely claim that the city had tested tap water from homes with lead service lines and therefore the highest lead poisoning risks however the city did not know the locations of lead service lines which city officials acknowledged in November after the Flint Journal MLive published an article revealing the practice using documents obtained under the Michigan Freedom of Information Act ", "The Journal MLive reported that the city had disregarded federal rules requiring it to seek out homes with lead plumbing for testing potentially leading the city and state to underestimate for months the extent of toxic lead leaching into Flint s tap water ", " In a report released on March of the recently tested sentinel sites had results above the ppb limit ", "Eight of the samples exceeded ppb ", " A study showed that significantly more samples exceeded the ppb limit in the voluntary or homeowner driven sampling program whereby concerned citizens decided to acquire a testing kit and conduct sampling on their own non sentinel sites ", " See Education and research section for later studies ", "On September Hurley Medical Center in Flint released a study led by Mona Hanna Attisha the program director for pediatric residency at Hurley Children s Hospital confirming that the proportion of infants and children with elevated levels of lead in their blood had nearly doubled since the city switched from the Detroit water system to using the Flint River as its water source ", " Using hospital records Hanna Attisha found that a steep rise in blood lead levels corresponded to the city s switch in water sources ", " The study was initially dismissed by MDEQ spokesman Brad Wurfel who repeated a familiar refrain Repeated testing indicated the water tested within acceptable levels ", " Later Wurfel apologized to Hanna Attisha ", " The team s study appears in the February issue of American Journal of Public Health ", " Hanna Attisha s research found that the average proportion of Flint children with elevated blood lead levels above five micrograms per deciliter or grams per milliliters of blood rose from before the change in water source to after the change in water source ", "In areas where water lead levels were considered high at ppb which is the maximum amount of lead allowed in water per the Safe Drinking Water Act Lead and Copper Rule the average proportion of Flint children with elevated blood lead levels rose from to ", " Michigan Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention Program data agree an increase occurred suggesting an increase from of children May April to May April ", "Hanna Attisha s data were taken from hospital laboratory records for children less than five years old ", "Hanna Attisha s sample numbers were large both for the pre switch and post switch time periods and for Flint children and for children not exposed to Flint water ", "Demographics were meaningfully different among the two groups ", "In terms of race of the children outside of Flint were African American while of the children in areas of high water lead levels ppb were African American and of the children in areas of lower water lead levels ppb were African American ", "Children outside of Flint had a younger average age years compared to areas inside Flint years ", "Socioeconomic status also represented a meaningful difference with children inside of Flint being more disadvantaged than those children who lived outside of Flint ", " In conclusion the study demonstrated that elevated lead levels in children s blood was correlated with elevated lead levels in Flint water ", "Because lead screening is not completed for all children such data may be skewed toward higher risk children and thus overestimate lead exposure especially in non high risk areas ", " Hanna Attisha and Flint resident LeeAnne Walters were awarded PEN America s Freedom of Expression Courage Award on May ", " In June the Journal of Pediatrics published a much expanded study of blood lead levels measured at Hurley Medical Center ", "The original study of Hurley records involved a total of children younger than years whose address could be mapped to a site inside Flint in two pre post month periods ", "The study led by Hern n F G mez involved children aged years over the year period ", "Data for were available from center s Epic EMR system records for earlier years were scrounged from legacy systems ", "The results show an increase in the fraction of children with elevated lead blood levels immediately pre post the water switch from to invoking a Bonferroni correction G mez argues the change is not statistically significant ", "These results are consistent with a CDC report which found that the fraction of all children under age with elevated lead blood level was nearly percent higher after the switch to Flint River water ", "The striking result of G mez et al ", "however is that during the year period the crisis years are actually the third and fourth lowest years for lead blood levels ", "That is the upward blip during the water switch sits on a rapid declining curve presumably because of the many lead mitigation projects that have been initiated nationally so that blood lead levels during the crisis are actually lower than those two years earlier ", "In September a team from Virginia Tech arrived in Flint ", "Led by Marc Edwards an expert on municipal water quality the team came to perform lead level testing on the Flint water supply working under a National Science Foundation grant ", "Edwards had been contacted by Flint resident LeeAnne Walters whose family had extreme health problems almost immediately following the switch to the Flint River water ", "Walters had attempted to act locally but she was repeatedly ignored by city state and EPA officials ", " The study found that Flint water was very corrosive and causing lead contamination in homes ", "It concluded in its report that Flint River water leaches more lead from plumbing than does Detroit water ", "This is creating a public health threat in some Flint homes that have lead pipe or lead solder ", " Edwards was shocked by the extent of the contamination but even more so by the inaction of the proper authorities after being made well aware of the contamination ", "Edwards and his team found that at least a quarter of Flint households had levels of lead above the federal level of ppb and that in some homes lead levels were at ppb ", "Edwards said It was the injustice of it all and that the very agencies that are paid to protect these residents from lead in water knew or should ve known after June at the very very latest of this year that federal law was not being followed in Flint and that these children and residents were not being protected ", "And the extent to which they went to cover this up exposes a new level of arrogance and uncaring that I have never encountered ", " Edwards team created a website called Flint Water Study with the main purposes of informing and creating support for Flint residents during the crisis ", "The site also summarized study results and became a comprehensive public database for all information related to the study ", " On January the Virginia Tech research team led by Edwards announced that it had completed its work ", "Edwards said We now feel that Flint s kids are finally on their way to being protected and decisive actions are under way to ameliorate the harm that was done ", "Edwards credited the Michigan ACLU and the group Water You Fighting For with doing the critical work of collecting and coordinating many water samples analyzed by the Virginia Tech team ", "Although the labor of the team composed of scientists investigators graduate students and undergraduates was free the investigation still spent more than for such expenses as water testing and payment of Michigan Freedom of Information Act costs ", "A GoFundMe campaign has raised over of the needed for the team to recover its costs ", " On January the city of Flint retained Edwards to monitor the city s water testing efforts ", " On March the Virginia Tech team was given from an EPA grant to re test the lead levels in Flint homes ", " On August Kelsey Pieper a member of Edwards research team said percent of residents that collected samples in July for the lead testing program had no detectable level of particulate lead in their water supply ", "She added the study yielded a lead reading of ppb just below the federal action level of ppb ", "However Pieper acknowledged the sampling which was conducted by volunteer residents does not fulfill the testing requirements of the federal Lead and Copper Rule ", "State testing of the most recent six month monitoring period which began January and complied with Lead and Copper Rule regulations showed a th percentile lead reading of ppb which exceeds the federal action level ", "Roughly percent of samples from the third round of expanded state sentinel site testing showed results below the lead action level ", "Edwards called the results the beginning of the end of the public health disaster associated with the water crisis ", " On December Edwards said lead was not detected in percent of Flint homes tested in November up from percent in July ", "He also advised people to continue using filters ", " On January the MDEQ told Mayor Weaver that the lead content of Flint water had fallen below the federal limit ", "The th percentile of lead concentrations in Flint was ppb from July through December below the action level of ppb ", "It was ppb in the prior six month period ", " On the next day Flint spokeswoman Kristin Moore said that anywhere from to homes in the city still needed service lines replaced and that the city was planning to complete homes per year through ", " On March MDEQ reported that Flint water sampled in February registered below the federal threshold for lead with percent of samples at or below ppb ", "February s water tests marked the seventh straight month in which city water was below the action level ", "February s testing also showed percent of samples taken at homes at risk of high lead levels were at or below ppb ", " On June the MDEQ reported their May testing showed percent of Tier I samples at or below ppb of lead with percent of the samples at or below ppb ", " On April Status Coup released the documentary Flushing Flint which claimed that the water testing conducted by MDEQ was falsified by MDEQ staff taking water samples after flushing running water from taps for several minutes before taking the samples contrary to normal procedures for water testing and by MDEQ staff telling residents that they should take water samples after flushing running water from their taps for several minutes ", " This would clearly contravene the EPA guidance that samples taken must be first draw samples at taps in homes buildings ", " These claims cast doubt on the MDEQ reports of improvements in water quality over previous years ", "On January Snyder said that cases of Legionnaires disease a waterborne disease were reported in Genesee County from June November resulting in deaths two more people later died from the disease ", "Although the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services MDHHS said that there is no evidence of a clear link between the spike in cases and the water system change Edwards stated the contaminated Flint water could be linked to the spike ", " In a second report released January state researchers had still not pin pointed the source of the outbreak ", " The next day an official at McLaren Regional Medical Center in Flint confirmed that there was a spike in Legionella cases in Flint and elsewhere in Genesee County but noted that there was no definitive data to support that McLaren Flint is the source of exposure for any patient testing positive for the Legionella antigen ", " The family of one of the people who died of Legionnaires filed a million lawsuit against McLaren ", " The Flint Journal obtained documents via the Michigan Freedom of Information Act on the Legionnaires outbreak and published an article on them on January ", "The documents indicated that on October employees of the Genesee County Health Department and the Flint water treatment plant met to discuss the county s concerns regarding the increase in Legionella cases and possible association with the municipal water system ", "By early October officials at MDEQ were aware of a possible link between the water in Flint and the Legionnaires outbreak but the public was never informed and the agency gave assurances about water safety in public statements and at public forums ", "An internal email on January from a supervisor at the health department said that the Flint water treatment plant had not responded in months to multiple written and verbal requests for information ", "In January following a breakdown in communication between the city and the county on the Legionnaires investigation the county filed a FOIA request with the city seeking specific water testing locations and laboratory results for coliform E coli heterotrophic bacteria and trihalomethanes and other information ", "In April the county health department contacted the CDC and in April a CDC employee wrote in an email that the Legionnaires outbreak was very large one of the largest we know of in the past decade and community wide and in our opinion and experience it needs a comprehensive investigation ", "However MDHHS told the county health department at the time that federal assistance was not necessary ", " Emails obtained by Progress Michigan in February indicate Snyder s office knew about the outbreak since March despite Snyder s claim he was only informed in January ", " On March Governor Snyder ordered an investigation of the MDHHS regarding the outbreak ", " On February the CDC discovered the first genetic links between city water and patients diagnosed with Legionnaires disease in Genesee County ", " The presence of Legionella in Flint was widespread said Janet Stout a research associate professor at the University of Pittsburgh and a national expert on the disease ", " The laboratory results show that strains of the bacteria were throughout the water system ", "Virginia Tech researcher Amy Pruden published a study that found Legionella levels up to times higher than normal tap water in Flint and said finding a patient whose clinical isolates or bacteria matched the McLaren water sample without having been hospitalized there suggests that same strain may have been elsewhere ", " On March affidavits filed by experts in court supported the conclusion that Flint water was connected to the Legionnaires disease outbreak ", "Janet Stout wrote in an affidavit It is my opinion to a reasonable degree of probability that the source water change and the subsequent management of the municipal water system caused conditions to develop within the municipal water distribution system that promoted Legionella growth and dispersion amplification and the significant increases in cases of Legionnaires disease in Genesee County in and ", "J David Krause director of Forensic Analytical Consulting Services and Hung K Cheung a doctor specializing in environmental and occupational medicine agreed with her claims ", " On February a study published in the journals Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences and mBio concluded that the outbreak of Legionnaires disease in Flint was caused by low levels of chlorine which at higher levels would have made it difficult for bacteria to replicate ", " Because chlorine reacts with heavy metals like lead and iron high levels of both in Flint s water may have been responsible for the decreased amount of chlorine available ", " On December research institute KWR from the Netherlands published the results of their re investigation of the outbreak in Environmental Health Perspectives ", "They found evidence for three sources strong evidence for exposure to a Flint hospital in and for of confirmed cases and weaker evidence for exposure to city water at home or living in the proximity of a specific cluster of cooling towers both only in ", "Each source could be associated with only a proportion of cases ", "They concluded that focus on a single source may have delayed recognition and remediation of other significant sources of L pneumophila and provided recommendations to improve Legionella prevention ", " One focus of inquiry is when Snyder became aware of the issue and how much he knew about it ", " In a July email Dennis Muchmore Snyder s chief of staff wrote to a Michigan Department of Health and Human Services MDHHS official I m frustrated by the water issue in Flint ", "I really don t think people are getting the benefit of the doubt ", "These folks are scared and worried about the health impacts and they are basically getting blown off by us as a state we re just not sympathizing with their plight ", " In a separate email sent on July MDHHS local health services director Mark Miller wrote to colleagues that it Sounds like the issue is old lead service lines ", "These emails were obtained under the Michigan Freedom of Information Act by Virginia Tech researchers studying the crisis and were released to the public in the first week of January ", " In October it was reported that the city government s data on lead water lines in the city was stored on index cards some dating back a century located in filing cabinets in Flint s public utility building ", " The Department of Public Works said that it was trying to transition the data into an electronic spreadsheet program but as of October only about of the index card information had been digitized ", " On October Snyder announced the creation of a five member Flint Water Advisory Task Force consisting of Ken Sikkema of Public Sector Consultants and Chris Kolb of the Michigan Environmental Council co chairs and Matthew Davis of the University of Michigan Health System Eric Rothstein of the Galardi Rothstein Group and Lawrence Reynolds of Mott Children s Health Center in Flint ", " On December the Task Force released its preliminary report saying that MDEQ bore ultimate blame for the Flint water crisis ", " The task force wrote that the MDEQ s Office of Drinking Water and Municipal Assistance adopted a minimalist technical compliance approach to water safety which was unacceptable and simply insufficient to the task of public protection ", "The task force also found that Throughout as the public raised concerns and as independent studies and testing were conducted and brought to the attention of MDEQ the agency s response was often one of aggressive dismissal belittlement and attempts to discredit these efforts and the individuals involved ", "We find both the tone and substance of many MDEQ public statements to be completely unacceptable ", "The task force also found that MDEQ has failed to follow the federal Lead and Copper Rule ", "That rule requires optimized corrosion control treatment but MDEQ staff instructed city of Flint water treatment staff that corrosion control treatment CCT would not be necessary for a year ", "The task force found that the decision not to require CCT made at the direction of the MDEQ led directly to the contamination of the Flint water system ", " The Flint Water Advisory Task Force s final report released March found the MDEQ MDHHS Governor s office and the state appointed emergency managers fundamentally accountable for the crisis saying the people of Flint were needlessly and tragically exposed to toxic levels of lead and other hazards ", " The task force s findings prompted the resignation of MDEQ director Dan Wyant and communications director Brad Wurfel ", " Flint Department of Public Works director Howard Croft also resigned ", " On January the U S Attorney s Office for the Eastern District of Michigan said that it was investigating ", " A month later they said they were working with the Federal Bureau of Investigation the EPA s Office of Inspector General the EPA s Criminal Investigation Division and the Postal Inspection Service on the investigation ", " The EPA battled Michigan s Department of Environmental Quality behind the scenes for at least six months over whether Flint needed to use chemical treatments to keep lead lines and plumbing connections from leaching into drinking water and did not publicize its concern that Flint residents health was jeopardized by the state s insistence that such controls were not required by law ", " In EPA water expert Miguel A Del Toral identified potential problems with Flint s drinking water in February confirmed the suspicions in April and summarized the looming problem in an internal memo circulated on June ", " Despite these dire warnings from Del Toral the memo was not publicly released until November after a revision and vetting process ", " In the interim the EPA and MDEQ engaged in a dispute on how to interpret the Lead and Copper Rule ", "According to EPA administrator Susan Hedman the EPA pushed to immediately implement corrosion controls in the interests of public health while MDEQ sought to delay a decision on corrosion control until two six month periods of sampling had been completed ", " Meanwhile Wurfel called Del Toral a rogue employee for his whistle blowing efforts ", " Marc Edwards who investigated the lead contamination wrote that Del Toral had made a heroic effort that was stymied by the EPA and MDEQ spending months wrangling over jurisdiction technicalities and legalities ", " In an interview with the Detroit News published on January Hedman said that the recommendation to DEQ regarding the need for corrosion controls occurred at higher and higher levels during this time period ", "And the answer kept coming back from DEQ that no we are not going to make a decision until after we see more testing results ", "Hedman said the EPA did not go public with its concerns earlier because state and local governments have primary responsibility for drinking water quality and safety there was insufficient evidence at that point of the extent of the danger and the EPA s legal authority to compel the state to take action was unclear and the EPA discussed the issue with its legal counsel who only rendered an opinion in November ", "Hedman said the EPA discussed the issue with its legal counsel and urged the state to have MDHHS warn residents about the danger ", " On January Hedman s resignation effective February was accepted ", " Assessments of the EPA s action varied ", "Edwards said that the assessment in Del Toral s original June memo was percent accurate and criticized the EPA for failing to take more immediate action ", "State Senate Minority Leader Jim Ananich Democrat of Flint said There s been a failure at all levels to accurately assess the scale of the public health crisis in Flint and that problem is ongoing ", "However the EPA s Miguel Del Toral did excellent work in trying to expose this disaster ", "Anyone who read his memo and failed to act should be held accountable to the fullest extent of the law ", " Del Toral later told The Flint Journal I was stunned when I found out they did not have corrosion control in place ", "In my head I didn t believe that ", "I thought That can t be true that s so basic ", "He also confirmed that unfiltered Flint water is still unsafe to drink and did not know when that would change ", " On January Michigan Attorney General Bill Schuette announced that his office would open an investigation into the crisis saying the situation in Flint is a human tragedy in which families are struggling with even the most basic parts of daily life ", " To oversee the his office s probe Schuette appointed Todd Flood as special prosecutor and Andrew Arena as chief investigator who led a team of nine full time investigators ", "At a media roundtable in February Flood said that the investigation could result in involuntary manslaughter charges if there was gross negligence leading to a death ", "Critics have questioned the objectivity of the investigation ", " In his annual State of the State address on January Snyder announced that he would release all of his emails from and regarding the crisis ", " The following day the governor s office released pages of emails ", "The New York Times summarized the documents provide a glimpse of state leaders who were at times dismissive of the concerns of residents seemed eager to place responsibility with local government and even as the scientific testing was hinting at a larger problem were reluctant to acknowledge it ", " Later that month in a class action lawsuit related to the crisis Snyder and the MDEQ were served subpoenas for the release of additional emails dating back to the beginning of ", " Emails highlighted by Progress Michigan in January indicate that Michigan state officials were trucking in bottled water to some of their own employees stationed in Flint as early as January in regards to the unsafe levels of trihalomethanes ", " On January two MDEQ employees Liane Shekter Smith former chief of the department s Office of Drinking Water and Municipal Assistance and Steve Busch former district supervisor in the division were suspended pending an investigation as a result of questions regarding actions related to water testing in Flint ", "In response Snyder said Michiganders need to be able to depend on state government to do what s best for them and in the case of the DEQ that means ensuring their drinking water is safe ", "Some DEQ actions lacked common sense and that resulted in this terrible tragedy in Flint ", "I look forward to the results of the investigation to ensure these mistakes don t happen again ", " Smith was fired on February ", " On January the Genesee County Commission approved a request from Genesee County Prosecuting Attorney David Leyton for to conduct an investigation into the crisis ", "The money will be used to hire two special prosecutors ", " On February Governor Snyder released additional emails between his office and the MDEQ which about the Legionnaires outbreak ", " On February Snyder s office released several thousand more emails regarding the crisis that date back to ", " An additional batch of emails was released on March ", " On March a report released by the Michigan Auditor General s office called the MDEQ s Office of Drinking Water and Municipal Assistance not sufficient in its oversight of the state s Community Water Supply Program ", " On July the Mackinac Center for Public Policy sued MDEQ over the department s day delay in responding to Freedom of Information Act FOIA requests surrounding Flint including a request for all emails from Shekter Smith and Bush from through containing the word Flint and a list of any employees transferred reassigned or suspended as a result of the Flint water issues ", " The case was settled in November with a joint statement saying in part The parties also note there are circumstances for which the FOIA currently lacks certainty when documents must be provided ", "This lack of clarity can foster litigation over what response times are reasonable ", " On April an article was published giving details of evidence of corruption and a coverup by Snyder and his fixer Rich Baird and stating that the statute of limitations on some of the most serious felony misconduct in office charges would expire on April ", " Responses from Michigan state authorities denied that a deadline was approaching and said that criminal prosecutions would follow ", " On January U S Representative Brenda Lawrence formally requested congressional hearings on the crisis saying We trust our government to protect the health and safety of our communities and this includes the promise of clean water to drink ", " The House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform began their hearings on the crisis on February ", "U S Representative Dan Kildee from Flint gave an opening statement ", "The first witnesses were EPA acting deputy assistant administrator Joel Beauvais Marc Edwards new MDEQ Director Keith Creagh and Flint resident LeeAnne Walters who alerted EPA water expert Miguel A Del Toral to the problem ", " On March the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee examining the Flint water crisis revealed the EPA state and municipal officials

resulted in really awful water quality ", " Failed infrastructure and economic decline resulted in the toxic levels of lead in the city s water supply ", " A corrosive water source was introduced into an aging water system without adequate corrosion control ", " Per Larry Clark Sustainable Performance Solutions LLC consulting professionals such as professional engineers licensed plumbers or water treatment specialists could have had a positive impact on the outcome ", " In addition to professional consultation EPA reform would help prevent another Flint water crisis ", "Current water testing techniques can underestimate water lead levels because sampling is sometimes concentrated on neighborhoods with known low lead levels or lead free pipes ", " EPA reform could enforce rules that ensure that all cities get an early warning when lead levels rise to the danger point ", " said Jeff Ruch executive director of Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility PEER ", " Upholding the Clean Water Act passed in would have prevented an outbreak of lead poisoning in Flint ", "This act established the basic structure for regulating pollutant discharges into the waters of the United States ",

Using point of use POU devices could prevent lead exposure ", "A study at the University of Arizona Tucson used the Flint Michigan water crisis to illustrate the economic benefits of utilizing three specific POU devices which included reverse osmosis activated carbon and distillation ", " Many factors such as POU device costs lead absorption from water and economic losses associated with reduced IQ were taken into account to determine the cost benefit of each device ", "The study found that the water lead level breakeven points for reverse osmosis activated carbon and distillation were g L g L and g L respectively ", " The cost benefit was analyzed as a year lifetime duration which is much longer than the Flint water crisis but these POU devices could still serve to be a valuable tool in preventing the consumption of water soluble lead in the future ", "Using predictive models could be another invaluable way to help prevent another crisis like the one in Flint ", "Many municipalities across the country have outdated or incomplete records on their water service line materials and governments have finite resources to identify and fix the problem of lead lines ", "In Flint it is clear that a data driven approach allowed public money to be spent more efficiently in ways that directly align with public health protection ", "Because the public utility owned portion of service lines is buried under roads and sidewalks it is expensive to verify pipe materials ", "Depending on the verification method it can range from a few hundred dollars to a few thousand dollars per home ", "Flint spent more than million on unnecessary excavations when it ignored model predictions in instead of targeting homes with the highest likelihood of having a lead service line ", " This could have been largely avoided with the continued use of the machine learning model developed in ", "As the water crisis unfolded residents experienced considerable anxiety over the physical and mental

belonging in the more specific bat and ball games category golf hockey tennis squash badminton and table tennis ", " In cricket s case a key difference is the existence of a solid target structure the wicket originally it is thought a wicket gate through which sheep were herded that the batter must defend ", " The cricket historian Harry Altham identified three groups of club ball games the hockey group in which the ball is driven to and from between two targets the goals the golf group in which the ball is driven towards an undefended target the hole and the cricket group in which the ball is aimed at a mark the wicket and driven away from it ", " It is generally believed that cricket originated as a children s game in the south eastern counties of England sometime during the medieval period ", " Although there are claims for prior dates the earliest definite reference to cricket being played comes from evidence given at a court case in Guildford in January Old Style equating to January in the modern calendar ", "The case concerned ownership of a certain plot of land and the court heard the testimony of a year old coroner John Derrick who gave witness that Being a scholler in the ffree schoole of Guldeford hee and diverse of his fellows did runne and play there at creckett and other plaies Given Derrick s age it was about half a century earlier when he was at school and so it is certain that cricket was being played c by boys in Surrey ", " The view that it was originally a children s game is reinforced by Randle Cotgrave s English French dictionary in which he defined the noun crosse as the crooked staff wherewith boys play at cricket and the verb form crosser as to play at cricket ", " One possible source for the sport s name is the Old English word cryce or cricc meaning a crutch or staff ", "In Samuel Johnson s Dictionary he derived cricket from cryce Saxon a stick ", " In Old French the word criquet seems to have meant a kind of club or stick ", " Given the strong medieval trade connections between south east England and the County of Flanders when the latter belonged to the Duchy of Burgundy the name may have been derived from the Middle Dutch in use in Flanders at the time krick e meaning a stick crook ", " Another possible source is the Middle Dutch word krickstoel meaning a long low stool used for kneeling in church and which resembled the long low wicket with two stumps used in early cricket ", " According to Heiner Gillmeister a European language expert of Bonn University cricket derives from the Middle Dutch phrase for hockey met de krik ket sen i e with the stick chase ", " Gillmeister has suggested that not only the name but also the sport itself may be of Flemish origin ", " Although the main object of the game has always been to score the most runs the early form of cricket differed from the modern game in certain key technical aspects the North American variant of cricket known as wicket retained many of these aspects ", " The ball was bowled underarm by the bowler and along the ground towards a batter armed with a bat that in shape resembled a hockey stick the batter defended a low two stump wicket and runs were called notches because the scorers recorded them by notching tally sticks ", " In the year Cotgrave s dictionary was published ecclesiastical court records at Sidlesham in Sussex state that two parishioners Bartholomew Wyatt and Richard Latter failed to attend church on Easter Sunday because they were playing cricket ", "They were fined d each and ordered to do penance ", " This is the earliest mention

racing and blood sports cricket was perceived to be a gambling sport ", " Rich patrons made matches for high stakes forming teams in which they engaged the first professional players ", " By the end of the century cricket had developed into a major sport that was spreading throughout England and was already being taken abroad by English mariners and colonisers the earliest reference to cricket overseas is dated ", " A newspaper report survives of a great cricket match played in Sussex for fifty guineas apiece this is the earliest known contest that is generally considered a First Class match ", " The patrons and other players from the social class known as the gentry began to classify themselves as amateurs fn to establish a clear distinction from the professionals who were invariably members of the working class even to the point of having separate changing and dining facilities ", " The gentry including such high ranking nobles as the Dukes of Richmond exerted their honour code of noblesse oblige to claim rights of leadership in any sporting contests they took part in especially as it was necessary for them to play alongside their social inferiors if they were to win their bets ", " In time a perception took hold that the typical amateur who played in first class cricket until when amateurism was abolished was someone with a public school education who had then gone to one of Cambridge or Oxford University society insisted that such people were officers and gentlemen whose destiny was to provide leadership ", " In a purely financial sense the cricketing amateur would theoretically claim expenses for playing while his professional counterpart played under contract and was paid a wage or match fee in practice many amateurs claimed more than actual expenditure and the derisive term shamateur was coined to describe the practice ", " The game underwent major development in the th century to become England s national sport ", " Its success was

as an eight foot line so that it extends four feet behind the bowling crease but is also in fact unlimited in length ", " Before a match begins the team captains who are also players toss a coin to decide which team will bat first and so take the first innings ", " Innings is the term used for each phase of play in the match ", " In each innings one team bats attempting to score runs while the

the type of match ", "A match with four scheduled innings is played over three to five days a match with two scheduled innings is usually completed in a single day ", " During an innings all eleven members of the fielding team take the field but usually only two members of the batting team are on the field at any given time ", "The exception to this is if a batter has any type of illness or injury restricting his or her ability to run in this case the batter is allowed a runner who can run between the wickets when the batter hits a scoring run or runs though this does not apply in international cricket ", " The order of batters is usually announced just before the match but it can be varied ", " The main objective of each team is to score more runs than their opponents but in some forms of cricket it is also necessary to dismiss all of the opposition batters in their final innings in order to win the match which would otherwise be drawn ", " If the team batting last is all out having scored fewer runs than their opponents they are said to have lost by n runs where n is the difference between the aggregate number of runs scored by the teams ", "If the team that bats last scores enough runs to win it is said to have won by n wickets where n is the number of wickets left to fall ", "For example a team that passes its opponents total having lost six wickets i e six of their batters have been dismissed have won the match by four wickets ", " In a two innings a side match one team s combined first and second innings total may be less than the other side s first innings total ", "The team with the greater score is then said to have won by an innings and n runs and does not need to bat again n is the difference between the two teams aggregate scores ", "If the team batting last is all out and both sides have scored the same number of runs then the match is a tie this result is quite rare in matches of two innings a side with only happening in first class matches from the earliest known instance in until January ", "In the traditional form of the game if the time allotted for the match expires before either side can win then the game is declared a draw

striker s wicket and behind him stands one of the fielders in a position called first slip ", "While the bowler and the first slip are wearing conventional kit only the two batters and the wicket keeper are wearing protective gear including safety helmets padded gloves and leg guards pads ", "While the umpire in shot stands at the bowler s end of the pitch his colleague stands in the outfield usually in or near the fielding position called square leg so that he is in line with the popping crease at the striker s end of the pitch ", "The bowling crease not numbered is the one on which the wicket is located between the return creases ", "The bowler intends to hit the wicket with the ball or at least to prevent the striker from scoring runs ", "The striker intends by using his bat to defend his wicket and if possible to hit the ball away from the pitch in order to score runs ", "Some players are skilled in both batting and bowling or as either of these as well as wicket keeping so are termed all rounders ", "Bowlers are classified according to their style generally as fast bowlers seam bowlers or spinners ", "Batters are classified according to whether they are right handed or left handed ", "Of the eleven fielders three are in shot in the image above ", "The other eight are elsewhere on the field their positions determined on a tactical basis by the captain or the bowler ", "Fielders often change position between deliveries again as directed by the captain or bowler ", " If a fielder is injured or becomes ill during a match a substitute is allowed to field instead of him but the substitute cannot bowl or act as a captain except in the case of concussion substitutes in international cricket ", " The substitute leaves the field when the injured player is fit to return ", " The Laws of Cricket were updated in to allow substitutes to act as wicket keepers ", " Most bowlers are considered specialists in that they are selected for the team because of their skill as a bowler although some are all rounders and even specialist batters bowl occasionally ", "The specialists bowl several times during an innings but may not bowl two overs consecutively ", "If the captain wants a bowler to change ends another bowler must temporarily fill in so that the change is not immediate ", " A bowler reaches his delivery stride by means of a run up and an over is deemed to have begun when the bowler starts his run up for the first delivery of that over the ball then being in play ", " Fast bowlers needing momentum take a lengthy run up while bowlers with a slow delivery take no more than a couple of steps before bowling ", "The fastest bowlers can deliver the ball at a speed of over kilometres per hour mph and they sometimes rely on sheer speed to try to defeat the batter who is forced to react very quickly ", " Other fast bowlers rely on a mixture of speed and guile by making the ball seam or swing i e ", "curve in flight ", "This type of delivery can deceive a batter into miscuing his shot for example so that the ball just touches the edge of the bat and can then be caught behind by the wicket keeper or a slip fielder ", " At the other end of the bowling scale is the spin bowler who bowls at a relatively slow pace and relies entirely on guile to deceive the batter ", "A spinner will often buy his wicket by tossing one up in a slower steeper parabolic path to lure the batter into making a poor shot ", "The batter has to be very wary of such deliveries as they are often flighted or spun so that the ball will not behave quite as he expects and he could be trapped into getting himself out ", " In between the pacemen and the spinners are the medium paced seamers who rely on persistent accuracy to try to contain the rate of scoring and wear down the batter s concentration ", " There are nine ways in which a batter can be dismissed five relatively common and four extremely rare ", "The common forms of dismissal are bowled caught leg before wicket lbw run out and stumped ", " Rare methods are hit wicket hit the ball twice obstructing the field and timed out ", " The Laws state that the fielding team usually the bowler in practice must appeal for a dismissal before the umpire can give his decision ", "If the batter is out the umpire raises a forefinger and says Out ", " otherwise he will shake his head and say Not out ", " There is effectively a tenth method of dismissal retired out which is not an on field dismissal as such but rather a retrospective one for which no fielder is credited ", " Batters take turns to bat via a batting order which is decided beforehand by the team captain and presented to the umpires though the order remains flexible when the captain officially nominates the team ", " Substitute batters are generally not allowed except in the case of concussion substitutes in international cricket ", " In order to begin batting the batter first adopts a batting stance ", "Standardly this involves adopting a slight crouch with the feet pointing across the front of the wicket looking in the direction of the bowler and holding the bat so it passes over the feet and so its tip can rest on the ground near to the toes of the back foot ", " A skilled batter can use a wide array of shots or strokes in both defensive and attacking mode ", "The idea is to hit the ball to the best effect with the flat surface of the bat s blade ", "If the ball touches the side of the bat it is called an edge ", "The batter does not have to play a shot and can allow the ball to go through to the wicketkeeper ", "Equally he does not have to attempt a run when he hits the ball with his bat ", "Batters do not always seek to hit the ball as hard as possible and a good player can score runs just by making a deft stroke with a turn of the wrists or by simply blocking the ball but directing it away from fielders so that he has time to take a run ", "A wide variety of shots are played the batter s repertoire including strokes named according to the style of swing and the direction aimed e g cut drive hook pull ", " The batter on strike i e ", "the striker must prevent the ball hitting the wicket and try to score runs by hitting the ball with his bat so that he and his partner have time to run from one end of the pitch to the other before the fielding side can return the ball ", "To register a run both runners must touch the ground behind the popping crease with either their bats or their bodies the batters carry their bats as they run ", "Each completed run increments the score of both the team and the striker ", " The decision to attempt a run is ideally made by the batter who has the better view of the ball s progress and this is communicated by calling usually yes no or wait ", "More than one run can be scored from a single hit hits worth one to three runs are common but the size of the field is such that it is usually difficult to run four or more ", " To compensate for this hits that reach the boundary of the field are automatically awarded four runs if the ball touches the ground en route to the boundary or six runs if the ball clears the boundary without touching the ground within the boundary ", "In these cases the batters do not need to run ", " Hits for five are unusual and generally rely on the help of overthrows by a fielder returning the ball ", "If an odd number of runs is scored by the striker the two batters have changed ends and the one who was non striker is now the striker ", "Only the striker can score individual runs but all runs are added to the team s total ", " Additional runs can be gained by the batting team as extras called sundries in Australia due to errors made by the fielding side ", "This is achieved in four ways no ball a penalty of one extra conceded by the bowler if he breaks the rules wide a penalty of one extra conceded by the bowler if he bowls so that the ball is out of the batter s reach bye an extra awarded if the batter misses the ball and it goes past the wicket keeper and gives the batters time to run in the conventional way leg bye as for a bye except that the ball has hit the batter s body though not his bat ", " If the bowler has conceded a no ball or a wide his team incurs an additional penalty because that ball i e delivery has to be bowled again and hence the batting side has the opportunity to score more runs from this extra ball ", " The captain is often the most experienced player in the team certainly the most tactically astute and can possess any of the main skillsets as a batter a bowler or a wicket keeper ", "Within the Laws the captain has certain responsibilities in terms of nominating his players to the umpires before the match and ensuring that his players conduct themselves within the spirit and traditions of the game as well as within the Laws ", " The wicket keeper sometimes called simply the keeper is a specialist fielder subject to various rules within the Laws about his equipment and demeanour ", "He is the only member of the fielding side who can effect a stumping and is the only one permitted to wear gloves and external leg guards ", " Depending on their primary skills the other ten players in the team tend to be classified as specialist batters or specialist bowlers ", "Generally a team will include five or six specialist batters and four or five specialist bowlers plus the wicket keeper ", " The game on the field is regulated by the two umpires one of whom stands behind the wicket at the bowler s end the other in a position called square leg which is about metres away from the batter on strike and in line with the popping crease on which he is taking guard ", "The umpires have several responsibilities including adjudication on whether a ball has been correctly bowled i e not a no ball or a wide when a run is scored whether a batter is out the fielding side must first appeal to the umpire usually with the phrase How s that ", "or Owzat ", " when intervals start and end and the suitability of the pitch field and weather for playing the game ", "The umpires are authorised to interrupt or even abandon a match due to circumstances likely to endanger the players such as a damp pitch or deterioration of the light ", " Off the field in televised matches there is usually a third umpire who can make decisions on certain incidents with the aid of video evidence ", "The third umpire is mandatory under the playing conditions for Test and Limited Overs International matches played between two ICC full member countries ", "These matches also have a match referee whose job is to ensure that play is within the Laws and the spirit of the game ", " The match details including runs and dismissals are recorded by two official scorers one representing each team ", "The scorers are directed by the hand signals of an umpire see image right ", "For example the umpire raises a forefinger to signal that the batter is out has been dismissed he raises both arms above his head if the batter has hit the ball for six runs ", "The scorers are required by the Laws to record all runs scored wickets taken and overs bowled in practice they also note significant amounts of additional data relating to the game ", " A match s statistics are summarised on a scorecard ", "Prior to the popularisation of

responsibility for ensuring fair play rests with the captains but extends to all players match officials and especially in junior cricket teachers coaches and parents ", " The umpires are the sole judges of fair and unfair play ", "They are required under the Laws to intervene in case of dangerous or unfair play or in cases of unacceptable conduct by a player ", "Previous versions of the Spirit

indicating that they can enter whenever they wish as long as a specific ritual is carried out first ", " Although Rashi tried to find a harmonistic explanation for this incongruity the Leviticus Rabbah maintains that it was indeed the case that the high priest could enter at any time if these rituals were carried out ", " Textual scholars argue that the ritual is composed from three sources and a couple of redactional additions On the basis of their assumptions these scholars believe that the original ceremony was simply the ritual purification of the sanctuary from any accidental ritual impurity at the start of each new year as seen in the Book of Ezekiel ", "Textual scholars date this original ceremony to before the priestly source but after JE ", " According to the Book of Ezekiel the sanctuary was to be cleansed by the sprinkling of bullock s blood on the first day of the first and of the seventh months near the start of the civil year and of the ecclesiastical year respectively although the masoretic text of the Book of Ezekiel has the second of these cleansings on the seventh of the first month biblical scholars regard the Septuagint which has the second cleaning as being the first of the seventh month as being more accurate here ", " It appears that during the period that the Holiness Code and the Book of Ezekiel were written the new year began on the tenth day of the seventh month and thus liberal biblical scholars believe that by the time the Priestly Code was compiled the date of the new year and of the day of atonement had swapped around ",

contrast the modern scholarly consensus rejects Mosaic authorship and affirms that the Torah has multiple authors and that its composition took place over centuries ", " The precise process by which the Torah was composed the number of authors involved and the date of each author are hotly contested ", "Throughout most of the th century there was a scholarly consensus surrounding the documentary hypothesis which posits four independent sources which were later compiled together by a redactor J the Jahwist source E the Elohist source P the Priestly source and D the Deuteronomist source ", "The earliest of these sources J would have been composed in the late th or the th century BCE with the latest source P being composed around the th century BCE ", "The consensus around the documentary hypothesis collapsed in the last decades of the th century ", " The groundwork was laid with the investigation of the origins of the written sources in oral compositions implying that the creators of J and E were collectors and editors and not authors and historians ", " Rolf Rendtorff building on this insight argued that the basis of the Pentateuch lay in short independent narratives gradually formed into larger units and brought together in two editorial phases the first Deuteronomic the second Priestly ", " By contrast John Van Seters advocates a supplementary hypothesis which posits that the Torah was derived from a series of direct additions to an existing corpus of work ", " A neo documentarian hypothesis which responds to the criticism of the original hypothesis and updates the methodology used to determine which text comes from which sources has been advocated by biblical historian Joel S Baden among others ", " Such a hypothesis continues to have adherents in Israel and

existed although its extent especially its end point is uncertain ", " The remainder is called collectively non Priestly a grouping which includes both pre Priestly and post Priestly material ", " The final Torah is widely seen as a product of the Persian period BCE probably BCE ", " This consensus echoes a traditional Jewish view which gives Ezra the leader of the Jewish community on its return from Babylon a pivotal role in its promulgation ", " Many theories have been advanced to explain the composition of the Torah but two have been especially influential ", " The first of these Persian Imperial authorisation advanced by Peter Frei in holds that the Persian authorities required the Jews of Jerusalem to present a single body of law as the price of local autonomy ", " Frei s theory was according to Eskenazi systematically dismantled at an interdisciplinary symposium held in but the relationship between the Persian authorities and Jerusalem remains a crucial question ", " discuss The second theory associated with Joel P Weinberg and called the Citizen Temple Community proposes that the Exodus story was composed to serve the needs of a post exilic Jewish community organised around the Temple which acted in effect as a bank for those who belonged to it ", " A minority of scholars would place the final formation of the Pentateuch somewhat later in the Hellenistic BCE or even Hasmonean BCE periods ", " Russell Gmirkin for instance argues for a Hellenistic dating on the basis that the Elephantine papyri the records of a Jewish colony in Egypt dating from the last quarter of the th century BCE make no reference to a written Torah the Exodus or to any other biblical event though it does mention the festival of Passover ", " Rabbinic writings state that the Oral Torah was given to Moses at Mount Sinai which according to the tradition of Orthodox Judaism occurred in BCE ", "The Orthodox rabbinic tradition holds that the Written Torah was recorded during the following forty years though many non Orthodox Jewish scholars affirm the modern scholarly consensus that the Written Torah has multiple authors and was written over centuries ", " The Talmud presents two opinions as to how exactly the Torah was written down by Moses ", "One opinion holds that it was written by Moses gradually as it was dictated to him and finished it close to his death and the other opinion holds that Moses wrote the complete Torah in one writing close to his death based on what was dictated to him over the years ", "The Talmud says that the last eight verses of the Torah that discuss the death and burial of Moses could not have been written by Moses as writing it would have been a lie and that they were written after his death by Joshua ", "Abraham ibn Ezra and Joseph Bonfils observed citation needed that phrases in those verses present information that people should only have known after the time of Moses ", "Ibn Ezra hinted and Bonfils explicitly stated that Joshua wrote these verses many years after the death of Moses ", "Other commentators do not accept this position and maintain that although Moses did not write those eight verses it was nonetheless dictated to him and that Joshua wrote it based on instructions left by Moses and that the Torah often describes future events some of which have yet to occur ", "All classical rabbinic views hold that the Torah was entirely Mosaic and of divine origin ", " Present day Reform and Liberal Jewish movements all reject Mosaic authorship as do most shades of Conservative Judaism ", " According to Legends of the Jews God gave Torah to the children of Israel after he approached every tribe and nation in the world and offered them the Torah but the latter refused it so they might have no excuse to be ignorant about it ", " In this book Torah is defined as one of the first things created as a remedy against the evil inclination and as the counselor who advised God to create human in the creation of

two thousand years since the destruction of the Temple in Jerusalem CE ", "In the th and th centuries CE new movements such as Reform Judaism and Conservative Judaism have made adaptations to the

only way to ensure that the Oral Law could be preserved ", "After many years of effort by a great number of tannaim the oral tradition was written down around CE by Rabbi Judah haNasi who took up the compilation of a nominally written version of the Oral Law the Mishnah Hebrew ", "Other oral traditions from the same time period not entered into the Mishnah were recorded as Baraitot external

Gemara together are called the Talmud ", "The rabbis in the Land of Israel also collected their traditions and compiled them into the Jerusalem Talmud ", "Since the greater number of rabbis lived in Babylon the Babylonian Talmud has precedence should the two be in conflict ", "Orthodox and Conservative branches of Judaism accept these texts as the basis for all subsequent halakha and codes of Jewish law which are held to be normative ", "Reform and Reconstructionist Judaism deny that these texts or the Torah itself for that matter may be used for determining normative law laws accepted as binding but accept them as the authentic and only Jewish version for understanding the Torah and its development throughout history ", " citation needed Humanistic Judaism holds that the Torah is a

"Sometimes the above phases of spoken Classical Hebrew are simplified into Biblical Hebrew including several dialects from the th century BCE to nd century BCE and extant in certain Dead Sea Scrolls and Mishnaic Hebrew including several dialects from the rd century BCE to the rd century CE and extant in certain other Dead Sea Scrolls ", " However today most Hebrew linguists classify Dead Sea Scroll Hebrew as a set of dialects evolving out of Late Biblical Hebrew and into Mishnaic Hebrew thus including elements from both but remaining distinct from either ", " By the start of the Byzantine Period in the th century CE Classical Hebrew ceased as a regularly spoken language roughly a century after the publication of the Mishnah apparently declining since the aftermath of the catastrophic Bar Kokhba revolt around CE ", "In the early th century BCE the Neo Babylonian Empire conquered the ancient Kingdom of Judah destroying much of Jerusalem and exiling its population far to the east in

Scribe Hermit Zealot and Priest classes maintained an insistence on Hebrew and all Jews maintained their identity with Hebrew songs and simple quotations from Hebrew texts ", " While there is no doubt that at a certain point Hebrew was displaced as the everyday spoken language of most Jews and that its chief successor in the Middle East was the closely related Aramaic language then Greek note scholarly opinions on the exact dating of that shift have changed very much ", " In the first half of the th century most scholars followed Abraham Geiger and Gustaf Dalman in thinking that Aramaic became a spoken language in the land of Israel as early as the beginning of Israel s Hellenistic period in the th century BCE and that as a corollary Hebrew ceased to function as a spoken language around the same time ", "Moshe Zvi Segal Joseph Klausner and Ben Yehuda are notable exceptions to this view ", "During the latter half of the th century accumulating archaeological evidence and

"The Qumran scrolls indicate that Hebrew texts were readily understandable to the average Israelite and that the language had evolved since Biblical times as spoken languages do ", " note Recent scholarship recognizes that reports of Jews speaking in Aramaic indicate a multilingual society not necessarily the primary language spoken ", "Alongside Aramaic Hebrew co existed within Israel as a

the religious importance of Hebrew grew in the Hellenistic and Roman periods and cites epigraphical evidence that Hebrew survived as a vernacular language though both its grammar and its writing system had been substantially influenced by Aramaic ", " According to another summary Greek was the language of government Hebrew the language of prayer study and religious texts and Aramaic was the language of legal contracts and trade ", " There was also a geographic pattern according to Bernard Spolsky by the beginning of the Common Era Judeo Aramaic was mainly used in Galilee in the north Greek was concentrated in the former colonies and around governmental centers and Hebrew monolingualism continued mainly in the southern villages of Judea ", " In other words in terms of dialect geography at the time of the tannaim Palestine could be divided into the Aramaic speaking regions of Galilee and Samaria and a smaller area Judaea in which Rabbinic Hebrew was used among the descendants of returning exiles ", " In addition it has been surmised that Koine Greek was the primary vehicle of communication in coastal cities and among the upper class of Jerusalem while Aramaic was prevalent in the lower class of Jerusalem but not in the surrounding countryside ", " After the suppression of the Bar Kokhba revolt in the nd century CE Judaeans were forced to disperse ", "Many relocated to Galilee so most remaining native speakers of Hebrew at that last stage would have been found in the north ", " The Christian New Testament contains some Semitic place names and quotes ", " The language of such Semitic glosses and in general the language spoken by Jews in scenes from the New Testament is often referred to as Hebrew in the text although this term is often re interpreted

term for these passages is Baraitot ", "The dialect of all these works is very similar to Mishnaic Hebrew ", "About a century after the publication of the Mishnah Mishnaic Hebrew fell into disuse as a spoken language ", "The later section of the Talmud the Gemara generally comments on the Mishnah and Baraitot in two forms of Aramaic ", "Nevertheless Hebrew survived as a liturgical and literary language in the form of later Amoraic Hebrew which sometimes occurs in the text of the Gemara ", "Hebrew was always regarded as the language of Israel s religion history and national pride and after it faded as a spoken language it continued to be used as a lingua franca among scholars and Jews traveling in foreign countries ", " After the nd century CE when the Roman Empire exiled most of the Jewish population of Jerusalem following the Bar Kokhba revolt they adapted to the societies in which they found themselves yet letters contracts commerce science philosophy medicine poetry and laws continued to be written mostly in Hebrew which adapted by borrowing and inventing terms ", "After the Talmud various regional literary dialects of Medieval Hebrew evolved ", "The most important is Tiberian Hebrew or Masoretic Hebrew a local dialect of Tiberias in Galilee that became the standard for vocalizing the Hebrew Bible and thus still influences all other regional dialects of Hebrew ", "This Tiberian Hebrew from the th to th century CE is sometimes called Biblical Hebrew because it is used to pronounce the Hebrew Bible however properly it should be distinguished from the historical Biblical Hebrew of the th century BCE whose original pronunciation must be reconstructed ", "Tiberian Hebrew incorporates the scholarship of the Masoretes from masoret meaning tradition who added vowel points and grammar points to the Hebrew letters to preserve much earlier features of Hebrew for use in chanting the Hebrew Bible ", "The Masoretes inherited a biblical text whose letters were considered too sacred to be altered so their markings were in the form of pointing in and around the letters ", "The Syriac alphabet precursor to the Arabic alphabet also developed vowel pointing systems around this time ", "The Aleppo Codex a Hebrew Bible with the Masoretic pointing was written in the th century likely in Tiberias and survives to this day ", "It is perhaps the most important Hebrew manuscript in existence ", "During the Golden age of Jewish culture in Spain important work was done by grammarians in explaining the grammar and vocabulary of Biblical Hebrew much of this was based on the work of the grammarians of Classical Arabic ", "Important Hebrew grammarians were Judah ben David Hayyujcode heb promoted to code he Jonah ibn Janah Abraham ibn Ezra and later in Provence David Kimhicode heb promoted to code he ", "A great deal of poetry was written by poets such as Dunash ben Labratcode heb promoted to code he Solomon ibn Gabirol Judah ha Levi Moses ibn Ezra and Abraham ibn Ezra in a purified Hebrew based on the work of these grammarians and in Arabic quantitative or strophic meters ", "This literary Hebrew was later used by Italian Jewish poets ", " The need to express scientific and philosophical concepts from Classical Greek and Medieval Arabic motivated Medieval Hebrew to borrow terminology and grammar from these other languages or to coin equivalent terms from existing Hebrew roots giving rise to a distinct style of philosophical Hebrew ", "This is used in the translations made by the Ibn Tibboncode heb promoted to code he family ", " Original Jewish philosophical works were usually written in Arabic ", " citation needed Another important influence was Maimonides who developed a simple style based on Mishnaic Hebrew for use in his law code

the ages as the main language for written purposes by all Jewish communities around the world for a large range of uses not only liturgy but also poetry philosophy science and medicine commerce daily correspondence and contracts ", "There have been many deviations from this generalization such as Bar Kokhba s letters to his lieutenants which were mostly in Aramaic and Maimonides writings which were mostly in Arabic but overall Hebrew did not cease to be used for such purposes ", "For example the first Middle East printing press in Safed modern Israel produced a small number of books in Hebrew in which were then sold to the nearby Jewish world ", " This meant not only that well educated Jews in all parts of the world could correspond in a mutually intelligible language and that books and legal documents published or written in any part of the world could be read by Jews in all other parts but that an educated Jew could travel and converse with Jews in distant places just as priests and other educated Christians could converse in Latin ", "For example Rabbi Avraham Danzig wrote the Chayei Adamcode heb promoted to code he in Hebrew as opposed to Yiddish as a guide to Halacha for the average year old Ibid ", "Introduction ", "Similarly Rabbi Yisrael Meir Kagan s purpose in writing the Mishnah Berurahcode heb promoted to code he was to produce a work that could be

which was established in was an early grocery store chain in Canada and the United States ", "It became common in North American cities in the s ", "Early chains like A P did not sell fresh meats or produce ", "During the s to reduce the hassle of visiting multiple stores U S grocery store chains like A P introduced the combination store ", " This was a grocery store which combined several departments under one roof but generally maintained the traditional system of clerks pulling products from shelves on request ", " By only one in three U S grocery stores was a combination store ", " The concept of a self service grocery store predates the supermarket it was developed by entrepreneur Clarence Saunders at his Piggly Wiggly stores the first of which opened in ", " Saunders was awarded several patents for the ideas he incorporated into his stores ", " The stores were a financial success and Saunders began to offer franchises ", "The general trend since then has been to stock shelves at night so that customers the following day can obtain their own goods and bring them to the front of the store to pay for them ", "Although there is a higher risk of shoplifting the costs of appropriate security measures ideally will be outweighed by reduced labor costs ", " unreliable source ", "Historically there has been much debate about the origin of the supermarket ", "For example Southern California grocery store chains Alpha Beta and Ralphs both have strong claims to the first supermarket ", " By both chains were already operating multiple square foot m self service grocery stores ", " However as of both chains were not yet true supermarkets in the modern sense because their prices remained quite high one of the most important defining features of the supermarket is cheap food ", " Their main selling point was free parking ", " Other strong contenders in Texas included Weingarten s and Henke Pillot ", " To end the debate the Food Marketing Institute in conjunction with the Smithsonian Institution and with funding from H J ", "Heinz researched the issue ", "They defined the attributes of a supermarket as self service separate product departments discount pricing marketing and volume selling ", " They determined that the first true supermarket in the United States was opened by a former Kroger employee Michael J Cullen on August inside a square foot m former garage in Jamaica Queens in New York City ", " The store King Kullen operated under the logic of pile it high and sell it cheap ", " Everything displayed for sale in the store had prices clearly marked meaning that consumers would no longer need to haggle over prices ", " Cullen described his store as the world s greatest price wrecker ", " At the time of his death in there were seventeen King Kullen stores in operation ", "Although Saunders had brought the world self service uniform stores and nationwide marketing Cullen built on this idea by adding separate food departments selling large volumes of food at discount prices and adding a parking lot ", " Early supermarkets like King Kullen were called cheapy markets by industry experts at the time this was soon replaced by the phrase super market ", " The compound phrase was then closed up to become the modern term supermarket ", " Other established American grocery chains in the s such as Kroger and Safeway Inc at first resisted Cullen s idea but were eventually were forced to build their own supermarkets as the economy sank into the Great Depression ", "American consumers became extraordinarily price sensitive at a level never experienced before ", " Kroger took the idea one step further and pioneered the first supermarket surrounded on all four sides by a parking lot ", " Once the large chains joined the supermarket trend the new retail format swept across the nation like a wildfire ", "The number of American supermarkets almost tripled from in states in to over in states in ", " One sign of the supermarket format s success in slashing labor costs overhead and food prices was that the percentage of disposable income spent by American consumers on food plunged from percent in to percent in ", " The modern era of cheap food had begun ", " As large chain stores began to dominate the American grocery landscape with their low overhead and low prices while crushing numerous independent small stores along the way a backlash to this radical alteration of food distribution infrastructure appeared in the form of numerous anti chain campaigns ", "The idea of monopsony proposed by Cambridge economist Joan Robinson in that a single buyer could outmaneuver a market of multiple sellers became a strong anti chain rhetorical device ", "With public backlash came political pressure to even the playing field for smaller vendors lacking the luxury of economies of scale ", "In the Robinson Patman Act was implemented as a way of preventing such large chains from using their buying power to reap advantages over small stores although the act was not well enforced and did not have much impact on such chains ", " Supermarkets rapidly proliferated across both Canada and the United States with the growth of automobile ownership and suburban development after World War II ", "Most North American supermarkets are located in suburban strip shopping centers as an anchor store along with other smaller retailers ", "They are generally regional rather than national in their company branding ", "Kroger is the most nationally oriented supermarket chain in the United States but it has preserved most of its regional brands including Ralphs City Market King Soopers Fry s Smith s and QFC ", " citation needed In Canada the largest such company is Loblaw which operates stores under a

South London taking ten times as much per week as the average British general store of the time ", "Other chains caught on and after Galvani lost out to Tesco s Jack Cohen in to buy the Irwin s chain the sector underwent a large amount of consolidation resulting in the big four dominant UK of today Tesco Asda Sainsbury s and Morrisons ", "In the s supermarkets frequently issued trading stamps as incentives to customers ", "Today most chains issue store specific membership cards club cards or loyalty cards ", "These typically enable the cardholder to receive special members only discounts on certain items when the credit card like device is scanned at check out ", " Sales of selected data generated by club cards is becoming a significant revenue stream for some supermarkets ", "Traditional supermarkets in many countries face intense competition from discounters such as Wal Mart Aldi and Lidl which typically is non union and operates with better buying power ", "Other competition exists from warehouse clubs such as Costco that offer savings to customers buying in bulk quantities ", "Superstores such as those operated by Wal Mart and Asda often offer a wide range of goods and services in addition to foods ", "In Australia Aldi Woolworths and Coles are the major players running the industry with fierce competition among all the three ", "The rising market share of Aldi has forced the other two to cut prices and increase their private label product ranges ", " The proliferation of such warehouse and superstores has contributed to the continuing disappearance of smaller local grocery stores increased dependence on the automobile suburban sprawl because of the necessity for large floor space and increased vehicular traffic ", "For example in of Wal Mart s billion domestic sales were recorded from grocery goods ", " Some critics consider the chains common practice of selling loss leaders to be anti competitive ", "They are also wary of the negotiating power that large often multinationals have with suppliers around the world ", " During the dot com boom Webvan an online only supermarket was formed and went bankrupt after three years and was acquired by Amazon ", "The British online supermarket Ocado which uses a high degree of automation in its warehouses was the first successful online only supermarket ", "Ocado expanded into providing services to other supermarket firms such as Waitrose and Morrisons ", "Grocery stores such as Walmart employ food delivery services offered by third parties such as DoorDash ", " Other online food delivery services such as Deliveroo in the United Kingdom have begun to pay specific attention to supermarket delivery ", " Delivery robots are offered by various companies partnering with supermarkets ", "Micro fulfillment centers MFC are relatively small warehouses with sophisticated automated rack and tote systems which prepare orders for pickup and delivery ", " Once the order is complete the customer will pick it up i e ", " click and collect or have it fulfilled via home delivery ", " Supermarkets are investing in micro fulfillment centers with the hope that automation can help reduce the costs of online commerce and ecommerce by shortening the distances from store to home and speeding up deliveries ", "In short MFCs are said by many to be the key to profitably fulfilling online orders ", " The U S FMI food industry association drawing on research by Willard Bishop defines the following formats store types that sell groceries Some supermarkets are focusing on selling more or even exclusively organically certified produce ", " Others are trying to differentiate themselves by selling fewer or no products containing palm oil ", " This as the demand of palm oil is a main driver for the destruction of rainforests ", "As a response to the growing concern on the heavy use of petroleum based plastics for food packaging so called zero waste and plastic free supermarkets and groceries are on the rise ", " Beginning in the s the food sector in developing countries has rapidly transformed particularly in Latin America South East Asia India China and South Africa ", "With growth has come considerable competition and some amount of consolidation ", " The growth has been driven by increasing affluence and the rise of a middle class the entry of women into the workforce with a consequent incentive to seek out easy to prepare foods the growth in the use of refrigerators making it possible to shop weekly instead of daily and the growth in car ownership facilitating journeys to distant stores and purchases of large quantities of goods ", "The opportunities presented by this potential have encouraged several European companies to invest in these markets mainly in Asia and American companies to invest in Latin America and China ", "Local companies also entered the market ", " Initial development of supermarkets has now been followed by hypermarket growth ", "In addition there were investments by companies such as Makro and Metro Cash and Carry in large scale Cash and Carry operations ", "While the growth in sales of processed foods in these countries has been much more rapid than the growth in fresh food sales the imperative nature of supermarkets to achieve economies of scale in purchasing means that the expansion of supermarkets in these countries has important repercussions for small farmers particularly those growing perishable crops ", "New supply chains have developed involving cluster formation development of specialized wholesalers leading farmers organizing supply and farmer associations or cooperatives ", " In some cases supermarkets have organized their own procurement from small farmers in others wholesale markets have adapted to meet supermarket needs ", " Larger supermarkets in North America and in Europe typically sell many items among many brands sizes and varieties ", "U S publisher Supermarket News lists the following categories for example Hypermarkets have a larger range of non food categories such as clothing electronics household decoration and appliances ", "Most merchandise is already packaged when it arrives at the supermarket ", "Packages are placed on shelves arranged in aisles and sections according to type of item ", "Some items such as fresh produce are stored in bins ", "Those requiring an intact cold chain are in temperature controlled display cases ", "While branding and store advertising will differ from company to company the layout of a supermarket remains virtually unchanged ", "Although big companies spend time giving consumers a pleasant shopping experience the design of a supermarket is directly connected to the in store marketing that supermarkets must conduct to get shoppers to spend more money while there ", "Every aspect of the store is mapped out and attention is paid to color wording and even surface texture ", "The overall layout of a supermarket is a visual merchandising project that plays a major role ", "Stores can creatively use a layout to alter customers perceptions of the atmosphere ", "Alternatively they can enhance the store s atmospherics through visual communications signs and graphics lighting colors and even scents ", " For example to give a sense of the supermarket being healthy fresh produce is deliberately located at the front of the store ", "In terms of bakery items supermarkets usually dedicate to feet of store space to the bread aisle ", " Supermarkets are designed to give each product section a sense of individual difference and this is evident in the design of what is called the anchor departments fresh produce dairy delicatessen meat and the bakery ", "Each section has different floor coverings style lighting and sometimes even individual services counters to allow shoppers to feel as if there are a number of markets within this one supermarket ", " Marketers use well researched techniques to try to control purchasing behavior ", "The layout of a supermarket is considered by some to consist of a few rules of thumb and three layout principles ", " The high draw products are placed in separate areas of the store to keep drawing the consumer through the store ", "High impulse and high margin products are placed in the most predominant areas to grab attention ", "Power products are placed on both sides of the aisle to create increased product awareness and end caps are used to receive a high exposure of a certain product whether on special promotion or in a campaign or a new line ", "The first principle of the layout is circulation ", "Circulation is created by arranging product so the supermarket can control the traffic flow of the consumer ", "Along with this path there will be high draw high impulse items that will influence the consumer to make purchases which they did not originally intend ", "Service areas such as restrooms are placed in a location which draws the consumer past certain products to create extra buys ", "Necessity items such as bread and milk are found at the rear of the store to increase the start of circulation ", "Cashiers desks are placed in a position to promote circulation ", "In most supermarkets the entrance will be on the right hand side because some research suggests that consumers who travel in a counter clockwise direction spend more ", " However other researchers have argued that consumers moving in a clockwise direction can form better mental maps of the store leading to higher sales in turn ", " The second principle of the layout is coordination ", "Coordination is the organized arrangement of product that promotes sales ", "Products such as fast selling and slow selling lines are placed in strategic positions in aid of the overall sales plan ", "Managers sometimes place different items in fast selling places to increase turnover or to promote a new line ", "The third principle is consumer convenience ", "The layout of a supermarket is designed to create a high degree of convenience to the consumer to make the shopping experience pleasant and increase customer spending ", " This is done through the character of merchandising and product placement ", "There are many different ideas and theories in relation to layout and how product layout can influence the purchases made ", "One theory suggests that certain products are placed together or near one another that are of a similar or complementary nature to increase the average customer spend ", " This strategy is used to create cross category sales similarity ", "In other words the toothpaste is next to or adjacent the toothbrushes and the tea and coffee are down the same aisle as the sweet biscuits ", "These products complement one another and placing them near is one way marketers try to increase purchases ", " For vertical placement cheap generic brands tend to be on the lowest shelves products appealing to children are placed at the mid thigh level and the most profitable brands are placed at eye level ", " The fourth principle is the use of color psychology and the locations of the food similar to its use in fast food branding ", "Consumer psychologists suggest that most buyers tend to enter the store and shop to their right first ", " Some supermarkets therefore choose to place the entrance to the left hand side as the consumer will likely turn right upon entry and this allows the consumer to do a full anticlockwise circle around the store before returning to the checkouts ", "This suggests that supermarket marketers should use this theory to their advantage by placing their temporary displays of products on the right hand side to entice you to make an unplanned purchase ", "Furthermore aisle ends are extremely popular with product manufacturers who pay top dollar to have their products located there ", " These aisle ends are used to lure customers into making a snap purchase and to also entice them to shop down the aisle ", "The most obvious place supermarket layout influences consumers are at the checkout ", "Small displays of chocolates magazines and drinks are located at each checkout to tempt shoppers while they wait to be served ", " Number of stores in brackets as of March Total number of stores in brackets "]},

maintain stability and breath on their own without the ventilator ", "This is done by changing the mode to one where they have to trigger breaths and ventilatory support is only given to compensate for the added resistance of the endotracheal tube ", " A cuff leak test is done to detect if there is airway edema to show the chances of post extubation stridor ", "This is done by deflating to the cuff to check if air begins leaking around the endotracheal tube ", " The function of the lungs is to provide gas exchange via oxygenation and ventilation ", "This phenomenon of respiration involves the physiologic concepts of air flow tidal volume compliance resistance and dead space ", " Other relevant concepts include alveolar ventilation arterial PaCO alveolar volume and FiO ", "Alveolar ventilation is the amount of gas per unit of time that reaches the alveoli and becomes involved in gas exchange ", " PaCO is the partial pressure of carbon dioxide of arterial blood which determines how well carbon dioxide is able to move out of the body ", " Alveolar volume is the volume of air entering and leaving the alveoli per minute ", " Mechanical dead space is another important parameter in ventilator design and function and is defined as the volume of gas breathed again as the result of use in a mechanical device ", "Due to the anatomy of the human pharynx larynx and esophagus and the circumstances for which ventilation is needed additional measures are required to secure the airway during positive pressure ventilation in order to allow unimpeded passage of air into the trachea and avoid air passing into the esophagus and stomach ", "The common method is by insertion of a tube into the trachea ", "Intubation which provides a clear route for the air can be either an endotracheal tube inserted through the natural openings of mouth or nose or a tracheostomy inserted through an artificial opening in the neck ", "In other circumstances simple airway maneuvers an oropharyngeal airway or laryngeal mask airway may be employed ", "If non invasive ventilation or negative pressure ventilation is used then an airway adjunct is not needed ", "Pain medicine such as opioids are sometimes used in adults and infants who require mechanical ventilation ", "For preterm or full term infants who require mechanical ventilation there is no strong evidence to prescribe opioids or sedation routinely for these procedures however some select infants requiring mechanical ventilation may require pain medicine such as opioids ", "It is not clear if clonidine is safe or effective to be used as a sedative for preterm and full term infants who require mechanical ventilation ", "When oxygen FiO is used initially for an adult it is easy to calculate the next FiO to be used and easy to estimate the shunt fraction ", " The estimated shunt fraction refers to the amount of oxygen not being absorbed into the circulation ", " In normal physiology gas exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide occurs at the level of the alveoli in the lungs ", "The existence of a shunt refers to any process that hinders this gas exchange leading to wasted oxygen inspired and the flow of un oxygenated blood back to the left heart which ultimately supplies the rest of the body with de oxygenated blood ", " When using oxygen the degree of shunting is estimated as mmHg measured PaO ", "For each difference of mmHg the shunt is ", " A shunt of more than should prompt a search for the cause of this hypoxemia such as mainstem intubation or pneumothorax and should be treated accordingly ", "If such complications are not present other causes must be sought after and positive end expiratory pressure PEEP should be used to treat this intrapulmonary shunt ", " Other such causes of a shunt include Mechanical ventilation utilizes several separate systems for ventilation referred to as the mode ", "Modes come in many different delivery concepts but all conventional positive pressure ventilators modes fall into one of two categories volume cycled or pressure cycled ", " A relatively new ventilation mode is flow controlled ventilation FCV ", " FCV is a fully dynamic mode without significant periods of no flow ", "It is based on creating a stable gas flow into or out of the patient s lungs to generate an inspiration or expiration respectively ", "This results in linear increases and decreases in intratracheal pressure ", "In contrast to conventional modes of ventilation there are no abrupt drop intrathoracic pressure drops because of the controlled expiration ", " Further this mode allows to use thin endotracheal tubes mm inner diameter to ventilate a patient as expiration is actively supported ", " In general the selection of which mode of mechanical ventilation to use for a given patient is based on the familiarity of clinicians with modes and the equipment availability at a particular institution ", " The design of the modern positive pressure ventilators were based mainly on technical developments by the military during World War II to supply oxygen to fighter pilots in high altitude ", "Such ventilators replaced the iron lungs as safe endotracheal tubes with high volume low pressure cuffs were developed ", "The popularity of positive pressure ventilators rose during the polio epidemic in the s in Scandinavia and the United States and was the beginning of modern ventilation therapy ", "Positive pressure through manual supply of oxygen through a tracheostomy tube led to a reduced mortality rate among patients with polio and respiratory paralysis ", "However because of the sheer amount of man power required for such manual intervention mechanical positive pressure ventilators became increasingly popular ", " Positive pressure ventilators work by increasing the patient s airway pressure through an endotracheal or tracheostomy tube ", "The positive pressure allows air to flow into the airway until the ventilator breath is terminated ", "Then the airway pressure drops to zero and the elastic recoil of the chest wall and lungs push the tidal volume the breath out through passive exhalation ", "Negative pressure mechanical ventilators are produced in small field type and larger formats ", " The prominent design of the smaller devices is known as the cuirass a shell like unit used to create negative pressure only to the chest using a combination of a fitting shell and a soft bladder ", "In recent years this device has been manufactured using various sized polycarbonate shells with multiple seals and a high pressure oscillation pump in order to carry out biphasic cuirass ventilation ", " Its main use has been in patients with neuromuscular disorders that have some residual muscular function ", " The latter larger formats are in use notably with the polio wing hospitals in England such as St Thomas Hospital in London and the John Radcliffe in Oxford ", " The larger units have their origin in the iron lung also known as the Drinker and Shaw tank which was developed in by J H Emerson Company and was one of the first negative pressure machines used for long term ventilation ", " It was refined and used in the th century largely as a result of the polio epidemic that struck the world in the s ", "The machine is in effect a large elongated tank which encases the patient up to the neck ", " The neck is sealed with a rubber gasket so that the patient s face and airway are exposed to the room air ", "While the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide between the bloodstream and the pulmonary airspace works by diffusion and requires no external work air must be moved into and out of the lungs to make it available to the gas exchange process ", "In spontaneous breathing a negative pressure is created in the pleural cavity by the muscles of respiration and the resulting gradient between the atmospheric pressure and the pressure inside the thorax generates a flow of air ", "In the iron lung by means of a pump the air is withdrawn mechanically to produce a vacuum inside the tank thus creating negative pressure ", " This negative pressure leads to expansion of the chest which causes a decrease in intrapulmonary pressure and increases flow of ambient air into the lungs ", "As the vacuum is released the pressure inside the tank equalizes to that of the ambient pressure and the elastic recoil of the chest and lungs leads to passive exhalation ", "However when the vacuum is created the abdomen also expands along with the lung cutting off venous flow back to the heart leading to pooling of venous blood in the lower extremities ", "The patients can talk and eat normally and can see the world through a well placed series of mirrors ", "Some could remain in these iron lungs for years at a time quite successfully ", " Some of the problems with the full body design were such as being unable to control the inspiratory to expiratory ratio and the flow rate ", "This design also caused blood pooling in the legs ", " Another type is the intermittent abdominal pressure ventilator that applies pressure externally via an inflated bladder forcing exhalation sometimes termed exsufflation ", "The first such apparatus was the Bragg Paul Pulsator ", " The name of one such device the Pneumobelt made by Puritan Bennett has to a degree become a generic name for the type ", " The most commonly used high frequency ventilator and only one approved in the United States is the A from Vyaire Medical ", "It works by using very small tidal volumes by setting amplitude and a high rate set in hertz ", "This type of ventilation is primarily used in neonates and pediatric patients who are failing conventional ventilation ", " The first type of high frequency ventilator made for neonates and the only jet type is made by Bunnell Incorporated ", "It works in conjunction with a separate CMV ventilator to add pulses of air to the control breaths and PEEP ", " One of the main reasons why a patient is admitted to an ICU is for delivery of mechanical ventilation ", "Monitoring a patient in mechanical ventilation has many clinical applications Enhance understanding of pathophysiology aid with diagnosis guide patient management avoid complications and assess trends ", "In ventilated patients pulse oximetry is commonly used when titrating FIO ", "A reliable target of Spo is greater than ", " The total PEEP in the patient can be determined by doing an expiratory hold on the ventilator ", "If this is higher than the set PEEP this indicates air trapping ", "The plateau pressure can be found by doing an inspiratory hold ", "This shows the actual pressure the patient s lungs are experiencing ", "Loops can be used to see what is occurring in the patient s lungs ", "These include flow volume and pressure volume loops ", "They can show changes in compliance and resistance ", "Functional Residual Capacity can be determined when using the GE Carestation ", "Modern ventilators have advanced monitoring tools ", "There are also monitors that work independently of the ventilator which allow for measuring patients after the ventilator has been removed such as a Tracheal tube test ", "Ventilators come in many different styles and method of giving a breath to sustain life ", " There are manual ventilators such as bag valve masks and anesthesia bags that require the users to hold the ventilator to the face or to an artificial airway and maintain breaths with their hands ", "Mechanical ventilators are ventilators not requiring operator effort and are typically computer controlled or pneumatic controlled ", " Mechanical ventilators typically require power by a battery or a wall outlet DC or AC though some ventilators work on a pneumatic system not requiring power ", "There are a variety of technologies available for ventilation falling into two main and then lesser categories the two being the older technology of negative pressure mechanisms and the more common positive pressure types ", "Common positive pressure mechanical ventilators include The trigger either flow or pressure is what causes a breath to be delivered by a mechanical ventilator ", "Breaths may be triggered by a patient taking their own breath a ventilator operator pressing a manual breath button or based on the set respiratory rate ", "The cycle is what causes the breath to transition from the inspiratory phase to the exhalation phase ", "Breaths may be cycled by a mechanical ventilator when a set time has been reached or when a preset flow or percentage of the maximum flow delivered during a breath is reached depending on the breath type and the settings ", "Breaths can also be cycled when an alarm condition such as a high pressure limit has been reached ", "Limit is how the breath is controlled ", "Breaths may be limited to a set maximum pressure or volume ", "Exhalation in mechanical ventilation is almost always completely passive ", "The ventilator s expiratory valve is opened and expiratory flow is allowed until the baseline pressure PEEP is reached ", "Expiratory flow is determined by patient factors such as compliance and resistance ", "There are various procedures and mechanical devices that provide protection against airway collapse air leakage and aspiration "]},

someone with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease COPD cystic fibrosis or other serious lung diseases should therefore prompt investigations to identify the possibility of a pneumothorax ", " Traumatic pneumothorax most commonly occurs when the chest wall is pierced such as when a stab wound or gunshot wound allows air to enter the pleural space or because some other mechanical injury to the lung compromises the integrity of the involved structures ", "Traumatic pneumothoraces have been found to occur in up to half of all cases of chest trauma with only rib fractures being more common

parietal pleura ", "Normally the two layers are separated by a small amount of lubricating serous fluid ", "The lungs are fully inflated within the cavity because the pressure inside the airways intrapulmonary pressure is higher than the pressure inside the pleural space intrapleural pressure ", "Despite the low pressure in the pleural space air does not enter it because there are no natural connections to an air containing passage and the pressure of gases in the bloodstream is too low for them to be forced into the pleural space ", " Therefore a pneumothorax can only develop if air is allowed to enter through damage to the chest wall or damage to the lung itself or occasionally because microorganisms in the pleural space produce gas ", " Once air enters the pleural cavity the intrapleural pressure increases resulting in the difference between the intrapulmonary pressure and the intrapleural pressure defined as the transpulmonary pressure to equal zero which cause the lungs to deflate in contrast to a normal transpulmonary pressure of mm Hg ", " Chest wall defects are usually evident in cases of injury to the chest wall such as stab or bullet wounds open pneumothorax ",

severe emphysema ", "Areas of necrosis tissue death may precipitate episodes of pneumothorax although the exact mechanism is unclear ", " Primary spontaneous pneumothorax PSP has for many years been thought to be caused by blebs small air filled lesions just under the pleural surface which were presumed to be more common in those classically at risk of pneumothorax tall males due to mechanical factors ", "In PSP blebs can be found in of cases compared to in the general population without a history of PSP ", " As these healthy subjects do not all develop a pneumothorax later the hypothesis may not be sufficient to explain all episodes furthermore pneumothorax may recur even after surgical treatment of blebs ", " It has therefore been suggested that PSP may also be caused by areas of disruption porosity in the pleural layer which are prone to rupture ", " Smoking may additionally lead to inflammation and obstruction of small airways which account for the markedly increased risk of PSPs in smokers ", " Once air has stopped entering the pleural cavity it is gradually reabsorbed ", " Tension pneumothorax occurs when the opening that allows air to enter the pleural space functions as a one way valve allowing more air to enter with every breath but none to escape ", "The body compensates by increasing the respiratory rate and tidal volume size of each breath worsening the problem ", "Unless corrected hypoxia decreased oxygen levels and respiratory arrest eventually follow ", " The symptoms of pneumothorax can be vague and inconclusive especially in those with a small PSP confirmation with medical imaging is usually required ", " In contrast tension pneumothorax is a medical emergency and may be treated before imaging especially if there is severe hypoxia very low blood pressure or an impaired level of consciousness ", "In tension pneumothorax X rays are sometimes required if there is doubt about the anatomical location of the pneumothorax ", " A plain chest radiograph ideally with the X ray beams being projected from the back posteroanterior or PA and during maximal inspiration holding one s breath is the most appropriate first investigation ", " It is not believed that routinely taking images during expiration would confer any benefit ", " Still they may be useful in the detection of a pneumothorax when clinical suspicion is high but yet an

of the hilum where blood vessels and airways enter the lung with cm as the cutoff while American guidelines state that the measurement should be done at the apex top of the lung with cm

various methods correlate poorly but are the best easily available ways of estimating pneumothorax size ", " CT scanning see below can provide a more accurate determination of the size of the pneumothorax but its routine use in this setting is not recommended ", " Not all pneumothoraces are uniform some only form a pocket of air in a particular place in the chest ", " Small amounts of

results of a controlled clinical trial was by James Lind a Scottish naval surgeon who conducted research on scurvy during his time aboard HMS Salisbury in the Channel Fleet while patrolling the Bay of Biscay ", "Lind divided the sailors participating in his experiment into six groups so that the effects of various treatments could be fairly compared ", "Lind found improvement in symptoms and signs of scurvy among the group of men treated with lemons or oranges ", "He published a treatise describing the results of this experiment in ", " An early critique of statistical methods in medicine was

and gaps in evidence ", " In the mid s Alvin Feinstein David Sackett and others published textbooks on clinical epidemiology which translated epidemiological methods to physician decision making ", " Toward the end of the s a group at RAND showed that large proportions of procedures performed by physicians were considered inappropriate even by the standards of their own experts ", " David M Eddy first began to use the term evidence based in in workshops and a manual commissioned by the Council of Medical Specialty Societies to teach formal methods for designing clinical practice guidelines ", "The manual was eventually published by the American College of Physicians ", " Eddy first published the term evidence based in March in an article in the Journal of the American Medical Association that laid out the principles of evidence based guidelines and population level policies which Eddy described as explicitly describing the available evidence that pertains to a policy and tying the policy to evidence instead of standard of care practices or the beliefs of experts ", "The pertinent evidence must be identified described and analyzed ", "The policymakers must determine whether the policy is justified by the evidence ", "A rationale must be written ", " He discussed evidence based policies in several other papers published in JAMA in the spring of ", " Those papers were part of a series of published in JAMA between and on formal methods for designing population level guidelines and policies ", " The term evidence based medicine was introduced slightly later in the context of medical education ", "In the autumn of Gordon Guyatt used it in an unpublished description of a program at McMaster University for prospective or new medical students ", " Guyatt and others first published the term two years later to describe a new approach to teaching the practice of medicine ", " In David Sackett and colleagues clarified the definition of this tributary of evidence based medicine as the conscientious explicit and judicious use of current best evidence in making decisions about the care of individual patients ", " It means integrating individual clinical expertise with the best available external clinical evidence from systematic research ", " This branch of evidence based medicine aims to make individual decision making more structured and objective by better reflecting the evidence from research ", " Population based data are applied to the care of an individual patient while respecting the fact that practitioners have clinical expertise reflected in effective and efficient diagnosis and thoughtful identification and compassionate use of individual patients predicaments rights and preferences ", " Between and the Evidence Based Medicine Working Group at McMaster University published the methods to a broad physician audience in a series of Users Guides to the Medical Literature in JAMA ", "In Rosenberg and Donald defined individual level evidence based medicine as the process of finding appraising and using contemporaneous research findings as the basis for medical decisions ", " In Greenhalgh used a definition that emphasized quantitative methods the use of mathematical estimates of the risk of benefit and harm derived from high quality research on population samples to inform clinical decision making in the diagnosis investigation or management of individual patients ", " The two original definitions which ", "highlight important differences in how evidence based medicine is applied to populations versus individuals ", "When designing guidelines applied to large groups of people in settings with relatively little opportunity for modification by individual physicians evidence based policymaking emphasizes that good evidence should exist to document a test s or treatment s effectiveness ", " In the setting of individual decision making practitioners can be given greater latitude in how they interpret research and combine it with their clinical judgment ", " In Eddy offered an umbrella definition for the two branches of EBM Evidence based medicine is a set of principles and methods intended to ensure that to the greatest extent possible medical decisions guidelines and other types of policies are based on and consistent with good evidence of effectiveness and benefit ", " In the area of evidence based guidelines and policies the explicit insistence on evidence of effectiveness was introduced by the American Cancer Society in ", " The U S Preventive Services Task Force USPSTF began issuing guidelines for preventive interventions based on evidence based principles in ", " In the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association applied strict evidence based criteria for covering new technologies ", " Beginning in specialty societies such as the American College of Physicians and voluntary health organizations such as the American Heart Association wrote many evidence based guidelines ", "In Kaiser Permanente a managed care organization in the US began an evidence based guidelines program ", " In Richard Smith wrote an editorial in the British Medical Journal and introduced the ideas of evidence based policies in the UK ", " In the Cochrane Collaboration created a network of countries to produce systematic reviews and guidelines ", " In the US Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality AHRQ then known as the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research or AHCPR established Evidence based Practice Centers EPCs to produce evidence reports and technology assessments to support the development of guidelines ", " In the same year a National Guideline Clearinghouse that followed the principles of evidence based policies was created by AHRQ the AMA and the American Association of Health Plans now America s Health Insurance Plans ", " In the National Institute for Clinical Excellence NICE was created in the UK ", " In the area of medical education medical schools in Canada the US the UK Australia and other countries now offer programs that teach evidence based medicine ", "A study of UK programs found that more than half of UK medical schools offered some training in evidence based medicine although the methods and content varied considerably and EBM teaching was restricted by lack of curriculum time trained tutors and teaching materials ", " Many programs have been developed to help individual physicians gain better access to evidence ", "For example UpToDate was created in the early s ", " The Cochrane Collaboration began publishing evidence reviews in ", " In BMJ Publishing Group launched Clinical Evidence a monthly periodical that provided brief summaries of the current state of evidence about important clinical questions for clinicians ", " By use of the term evidence based had extended to other levels of the health care system ", "An example is evidence based health services which seek to increase the competence of health service decision makers and the practice of evidence based medicine at the organizational or institutional level ", " The multiple tributaries of evidence based medicine share an emphasis on the importance of incorporating evidence from formal research in medical policies and decisions ", "However because they differ on the extent to which they require good evidence of effectiveness before promoting a guideline or payment policy a distinction is sometimes made between evidence based medicine and science based medicine which also takes into account factors such as prior plausibility and compatibility with established science as when medical organizations promote controversial treatments such as acupuncture ", " Differences also exist regarding the extent to which it is feasible to incorporate individual level information in decisions ", "Thus evidence based guidelines and policies may not readily hybridise with experience based practices orientated towards ethical clinical judgement and can lead to contradictions contest and unintended crises ", " The most effective knowledge leaders managers and clinical leaders use a broad range of management knowledge in their decision making rather than just formal evidence ", " Evidence based guidelines may provide the basis for governmentality in health care and consequently play a central role in the governance of contemporary health care systems ", " The steps for designing explicit evidence based guidelines were described in the late s formulate the question population intervention comparison intervention outcomes time horizon setting search the literature to identify studies that inform the question interpret each study to determine precisely what it says about the question if several studies address the question synthesize their results meta analysis summarize the evidence in evidence tables compare the benefits harms and costs in a balance sheet draw a conclusion about the preferred practice write the guideline write the rationale for the guideline have others review each of the previous steps implement the guideline ", " For the purposes of medical education and individual level decision making five steps of EBM in practice were described in and the experience of delegates attending the Conference of Evidence Based Health Care Teachers and Developers was summarized into five steps and published in ", " This five step process can broadly be categorized as follows Systematic reviews of published research studies are a major part of the evaluation of particular treatments ", "The Cochrane Collaboration is one of the best known organisations that conducts systematic reviews ", "Like other producers of systematic reviews it requires authors to provide a detailed study protocol as well as a reproducible plan of their literature search and evaluations of the evidence ", " After the best evidence is assessed treatment is categorized as likely to be beneficial likely to be harmful or without evidence to support either benefit or harm ", "A analysis of systematic reviews from all Cochrane Collaboration Review Groups found that of the reviews concluded that the intervention was likely to be beneficial concluded that the intervention was likely to be harmful and concluded that evidence did not support either benefit or harm ", " recommended further research ", " In a study assessed the role of systematic reviews produced by Cochrane Collaboration to inform US private payers policymaking it showed that although the medical policy documents of major US private payers were informed by Cochrane systematic reviews there was still scope to encourage the further use ", " Evidence based medicine categorizes different types of clinical evidence and rates or grades them according to the strength of their freedom from the various biases that beset medical research ", "For example the strongest evidence for therapeutic interventions is provided by systematic review of randomized well blinded placebo controlled trials with allocation concealment and complete follow up involving a homogeneous patient population and medical condition ", "In contrast patient testimonials case reports and even expert opinion have little value as proof because of the placebo effect the biases inherent in observation and reporting of cases and difficulties in ascertaining who is an expert however some critics have argued that expert opinion does not belong in the rankings of the quality of empirical evidence because it does not represent a form of empirical evidence and continue that expert opinion would seem to be a separate complex type of knowledge that would not fit into hierarchies otherwise limited to empirical evidence alone ", " Several organizations have developed grading systems for assessing the quality of evidence ", "For example in the U S Preventive Services Task Force USPSTF put forth the following system Another example are the Oxford CEBM Levels of Evidence published by the Centre for Evidence Based Medicine ", "First released in September the Levels of Evidence provide a way to rank evidence for claims about prognosis diagnosis treatment benefits treatment harms and screening which most grading schemes do not address ", "The original CEBM Levels were Evidence Based On Call to make the process of finding evidence feasible and its results explicit ", "In an international team redesigned the Oxford CEBM Levels to make them more understandable and to take into account recent developments in evidence ranking schemes ", "The Oxford CEBM Levels of Evidence have been used by patients and clinicians as well as by experts to develop clinical guidelines such as recommendations for the optimal use of phototherapy and topical therapy in psoriasis and guidelines for the use of the BCLC staging system for diagnosing and monitoring hepatocellular carcinoma in Canada ", " In a system was developed by the Grading of Recommendations Assessment Development and Evaluation GRADE working group ", "The GRADE system takes into account more dimensions than just the quality of medical research ", " It requires users who are performing an assessment of the quality of evidence usually as part of a systematic review to consider the impact of different factors on their confidence in the results ", "Authors of GRADE tables assign one of four levels to evaluate the quality of evidence on the basis of their confidence that the observed effect a numeric value is close to the true effect ", "The confidence value is based on judgments assigned in five different domains in a structured manner ", " The GRADE working group defines quality of evidence and strength of recommendations based on the quality as two different concepts that are commonly confused with each other ", " Systematic reviews may include randomized controlled trials that have low risk of bias or observational studies that have high risk of bias ", "In the case of randomized controlled trials the quality of evidence is high but can be downgraded in five different domains ", " In the case of observational studies per GRADE the quality of evidence starts off lower and may be upgraded in three domains in addition to being subject to downgrading ", " Meaning of the levels of quality of evidence as per GRADE In guidelines and other publications recommendation for a clinical service is classified by the balance of risk versus benefit and the level of evidence on which this information is based ", "The U S Preventive Services Task Force uses the following system GRADE guideline panelists may make strong or weak recommendations on the basis of further criteria ", "Some of the important criteria are the balance between desirable and undesirable effects not considering cost the quality of the evidence values and preferences and costs resource utilization ", " Despite the differences between systems the purposes are the same to guide users of clinical research information on which studies are likely to be most valid ", "However the individual studies still require careful critical appraisal ", " citation needed Evidence based medicine attempts to express clinical benefits of tests and treatments using mathematical methods ", "Tools used by practitioners of evidence based medicine include Evidence based medicine attempts to objectively evaluate the quality of clinical research by critically assessing techniques reported by researchers in their publications ", "There are a number of limitations and criticisms of evidence based medicine ", " Two widely cited categorization schemes for the various published critiques of EBM include the three fold division of Straus and McAlister limitations universal to the practice of medicine limitations unique to evidence based medicine and misperceptions of evidence based medicine and the five point categorization of Cohen Stavri and Hersh EBM is a poor philosophic basis for medicine defines evidence too narrowly is not evidence based is limited in usefulness when applied to individual patients or reduces the autonomy of the doctor patient relationship ", " In no particular order some published objections include A study Why all randomised controlled trials produce biased results assessed the most cited RCTs and argued that trials face a wide range of biases and constraints from trials only being able to study a small set of questions amenable to randomisation and generally only being able to assess the average treatment effect of a sample to limitations in extrapolating results to another context among many others outlined in the study ", " Despite the emphasis on evidence based medicine unsafe or ineffective medical practices continue to be applied because of patient demand for tests or treatments because of failure to access information about the evidence or because of the rapid pace of change in the scientific evidence ", " For example between and the evidence shifted on hundreds of medical practices including whether hormone replacement therapy was safe whether babies should be given certain vitamins and whether antidepressant drugs are effective in people with Alzheimer s disease ", " Even when the evidence unequivocally shows that a treatment is either not safe or not effective it may take many years for other treatments to be adopted ", " There are many factors that contribute to lack of uptake or implementation of evidence based recommendations ", " These include lack of awareness at the individual clinician or patient micro level lack of institutional support at the organisation level meso level or higher at the policy macro level ", " In other cases significant change can require a generation of physicians to retire or die and be replaced by physicians who were trained with more recent evidence ", " Physicians may also reject evidence that conflicts with their anecdotal experience or because of cognitive biases for example a vivid memory of a rare but shocking outcome the availability heuristic such as a patient dying after refusing treatment ", " They may overtreat to do something or to address a patient s emotional needs ", " They may worry about malpractice charges based on a discrepancy between what the patient expects and what the evidence recommends ", " They may also overtreat or provide ineffective treatments because the treatment feels biologically plausible ", " It is the responsibility of those developing clinical guidelines to include an implementation plan to facilitate uptake ", " The implementation process will involve will include an implementation plan analysis of the context identifying barriers and facilitators and designing the strategies to address them ", " Training in evidence based medicine is offered across the continuum of medical education ", " The Berlin questionnaire and the Fresno Test are validated instruments for assessing the effectiveness of education in evidence based medicine ", " These questionnaires have been used in diverse settings ", " A Campbell systematic review that included trials examined the effectiveness of e learning in improving evidence based health care knowledge and practice ", "It was found that e learning compared to no learning improves evidence based health care knowledge and skills but not attitudes and behaviour ", "No difference in outcomes is present when comparing e learning with face to face learning ", "Combining e learning and face to face learning blended learning has a positive impact on evidence based knowledge skills attitude and behaviour ", " As a form of e learning some medical school students engage in editing Wikipedia to increase their EBM skills and some students construct EBM materials to develop their skills in communicating medical knowledge ", " "]},

state government revenues were declining ", "During the last downturn the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of JGTRRA included federal assistance to states which helped states avoid tightening their Medicaid and SCHIP eligibility rules ", "The authors conclude that Congress should consider similar relief for the current economic downturn ", " Prior to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act medical underwriting was common but after the law came into effect in it became effectively prohibited ", "Medical underwriting made difficult for many consumers to purchase coverage on the individual market ", "Medical underwriting meant that insurance companies screen applicants for pre existing conditions and reject those with serious conditions such as arthritis cancer and heart disease but also such common ailments as acne being pounds over or under weight and old sports injuries ", " In an estimated million of those without health insurance were considered uninsurable because of pre existing conditions ", " Proponents of medical underwriting argue that it ensures that individual health insurance premiums are kept as low as possible ", " Critics of medical underwriting believe that it unfairly prevents people with relatively minor and treatable pre existing conditions from obtaining health insurance ", " One large industry survey found that of applicants for individual health insurance who went through medical underwriting were denied coverage in ", "Declination rates increased significantly with age rising from for those under to just under one third for those aged to ", " Among those who were offered coverage the study found that received offers at standard premium rates and were offered higher rates ", " The frequency of

applicants in their s were offered coverage and three quarters of those were offered standard rates ", "Seventy percent of applicants age were offered coverage but almost half the time it was at an increased premium ", "The study did not address how many applicants who were offered coverage at increased rates chose to decline the policy ", "A study conducted by the Commonwealth Fund in found that among those aged to who sought individual health insurance during the previous three years the majority found it unaffordable and less than a third ended up purchasing insurance ", "This study did not distinguish between consumers who were quoted increased rates due to medical underwriting and those who qualified for standard or preferred premiums ", " Some states have outlawed medical underwriting as a prerequisite for individually purchased health coverage ", " These states tend to have the highest premiums for individual health insurance ", " Americans who are uninsured may be so

have small group coverage and most likely to become uninsured if they have individual health insurance ", "But for people in poor or fair health the chances of losing coverage are much greater for people who had small group insurance than for those who had individual insurance ", "The authors attribute these results to the combination in the individual market of high costs and guaranteed renewability of coverage ", "Individual coverage costs more if it is purchased after a person becomes unhealthy but provides better protection compared to group insurance against high premiums for already individually insured people who become high risk ", "Healthy individuals are more likely to drop individual coverage than less expensive subsidized employment based coverage but group coverage leaves them more vulnerable to dropping or losing any and all coverage than does individual insurance if they become seriously ill Roughly a quarter of the uninsured are eligible for public coverage

year ", " One of the authors characterized the results as now one dies every minutes ", " Since then as the number of uninsured has risen from about million in to million in the number of preventable deaths due to lack of insurance has grown to about per year ", " A survey released in found that being uninsured impacts American consumers health in the following ways The costs of treating the uninsured must often be absorbed by providers as charity care passed on to the insured via cost shifting and higher health insurance premiums or paid by taxpayers through higher taxes ", " On the other hand the uninsured often subsidize the insured because the uninsured use fewer services and are often billed at a higher rate ", " A study found that in uninsured patients presenting in U S emergency departments were less likely to be admitted for inpatient care than those with Medicare Medicaid or private insurance ", " Minutes reported Hospitals charge uninsured patients two three four or more times what an insurance company would pay for the same treatment ", " On average per capita health care spending on behalf of the uninsured is a bit more than half that for the insured ", " Hospitals and other providers are reimbursed for the cost of providing uncompensated care via a federal matching fund program ", "Each state enacts legislation governing the reimbursement of funds to providers ", "In Missouri for example providers assessments totaling million are matched for each assessed to create a pool of approximately billion ", "By federal law these funds are transferred to the Missouri Hospital Association for disbursement to hospitals for the costs incurred providing uncompensated care including Disproportionate Share Payments to hospitals with high quantities of uninsured patients Medicaid shortfalls Medicaid managed care payments to insurance companies and other costs incurred by hospitals ", " In New Hampshire by statute reimbursable uncompensated care

in Health Affairs found that covering all of the uninsured in the US would increase national spending on health care by billion which would represent a increase in health care spending and of GDP ", " From society s perspective covering the uninsured is still a good investment ", "Failure to act in the near term will only make it more expensive to cover the uninsured in the future while adding to the amount of lost productivity from not insuring all Americans said Professor Jack Hadley the study s lead author ", "The impact on government spending could be higher depending on the details of the plan used to increase coverage and the extent to which new public coverage crowded out existing private coverage ", " Over of personal bankruptcies is caused by medical bills ", "Most of these persons had medical insurance ", " From to the Institute of Medicine s Committee on the Consequences of Uninsurance issued a series of six reports that reviewed and reported on the evidence on the effects of the lack of health insurance coverage ", " The reports concluded that the committee recommended that the nation should implement a strategy to achieve universal health insurance coverage ", "As of a comprehensive national plan to address what universal health plan supporters terms America s uninsured crisis has yet to be enacted ", "A few states have achieved progress towards the goal of universal health insurance coverage such as Maine Massachusetts and Vermont but other states including California have failed attempts of reforms ", " The six reports created by the Institute of Medicine IOM found that the principal consequences of uninsurance were the following Children and Adults without health insurance did not receive needed medical care they typically live in poorer health and die earlier than children or adults who have insurance ", "The financial stability of a whole family can be put at risk if only one person is uninsured and needs treatment for unexpected health care costs ", "The overall health status of a community can be adversely affected by a higher percentage of uninsured people within the community ", "The coverage gap between the insured and the uninsured has not decreased even after the recent federal initiatives to extend health insurance coverage ", " The last report was published in and was named Insuring America s Health Principles and Recommendations ", "This report recommended the following The President and Congress need to develop a strategy to achieve universal insurance coverage and establish a firm schedule to reach this goal by the year ", "The committee also recommended that the federal and state governments provide sufficient resources for Medicaid and the State Children s Health Insurance Program SCHIP to cover all persons currently eligible until the universal coverage takes effect ", "They also warned that the federal and state governments should prevent the erosion of outreach efforts eligibility enrollment and coverage of these specific programs ", " Some people think that not having health insurance will have adverse consequences for the health of the uninsured ", " On the other hand some people believe that children and adults without health insurance have access to needed health care services at hospital emergency rooms community health centers or other safety net facilities offering charity care ", " Some observers note that there is a solid body of evidence showing that a substantial proportion of U S health care expenditures is directed toward care that is not effective and may sometimes even be harmful ", " At least for the insured population spending more and using more health care services does not always yield better health outcomes or increase life expectancy ", " Children in America are typically perceived as in good health relative to adults due to the fact that most serious health problems occur later in one s life ", "Certain conditions including asthma diabetes and obesity have become much more prevalent among children in the past few decades ", " There is also a growing population of vulnerable children with special health care needs that require ongoing medical attention which would not be accessible without health insurance ", "More than million children in the United States meet the federal definition of children with special health care needs who have or are at increased risk for a chronic physical development behavioral or emotional condition and who also require health and related services of a type or amount beyond that required by children generally ", " These children require health related services of an amount beyond that required by the average children in America ", "Typically when children acquire health insurance they are much less likely to experience previously unmet health care needs this includes the average child in America and children with special health care needs ", " The Committee on Health Insurance Status and Its Consequences concluded that the effects of health insurance on children s health outcomes Children with health insurance receive more timely diagnosis of serious health conditions experience fewer hospitalizations and miss fewer days of school ", "The same committee analyzed the effects of health insurance on adult s health outcomes adults who do not have health insurance coverage who acquire Medicare coverage at age experience substantially improved health and functional status particularly those who have cardiovascular disease or diabetes ", "Adults who have cardiovascular disease or other cardiac risk factors that are uninsured are less likely to be aware of their condition which leads to worse health outcomes for those individuals ", "Without health insurance adults are more likely to be diagnosed with certain cancers that would have been detectable earlier by screening by a clinician if they had regularly visited a doctor ", "As a consequence these adults are more likely to die from their diagnosed cancer or suffer poorer health outcomes ", " Many towns and cities in the United States have high concentrations of people under the age of who lack health insurance ", " There are implications of high rates of uninsurance for communities and for insured people in those communities ", "Institute of Medicine committee warned of the potential problems of high rates of uninsurance for local health care including reduced access to clinic based primary care specialty services and hospital based emergency services ", " In October Health Affairs writers summarized the results of several studies that placed the higher death rates for the uninsured between per to per persons without insurance Based on the ACS coverage data we estimate that between and excess deaths among non elderly US adults may have occurred over the time period due to coverage losses during these years ", "Using the NHIS figures for coverage losses yields a higher estimate between and non elderly adult deaths attributable to coverage losses while the CPS figures yield an estimate of excess deaths among non elderly adults ", "These figures do not completely capture the population effects of coverage loss as they exclude the excess deaths that would likely result from coverage losses among children ", "In and beyond we can project even more loss of life if as expected millions more lose health coverage due to the economic downturn associated with the pandemic ", " EMTALA enacted by the federal government in requires that hospital emergency departments treat emergency conditions of all patients regardless of their ability to pay and is considered a critical element in the safety net for the uninsured ", "However the federal law established no direct payment mechanism for such care ", "Indirect payments and reimbursements through federal and state government programs have never fully compensated public and private hospitals for the full cost of care mandated by EMTALA ", "In fact more than half of all emergency care in the U S now goes uncompensated ", " According to some analyses EMTALA is an unfunded mandate that has contributed to financial pressures on hospitals in the last years causing them to consolidate and close facilities and contributing to emergency room overcrowding ", "According to the Institute of Medicine between and emergency room visits in the U S grew by while in the same period the number of emergency departments declined by ", " Hospitals bill uninsured patients directly under the fee for service model often charging much more than insurers would pay and patients may become bankrupt when hospitals file lawsuits to collect ", "Mentally ill patients present a unique challenge for

medically stable regional mental health agencies are contacted to evaluate them ", "Patients are evaluated as to whether they are a danger to themselves or others ", "Those meeting this criterion are

state with its members identifiable by their distinct military uniform ", "It may consist of one or more military branches such as an army navy air force space force marines or coast guard ", "The main task of the military is usually defined as defence of the state and its interests against external armed threats ", "In broad usage the terms armed forces and military are often treated as synonymous although in technical usage a distinction is sometimes made in which a country s armed forces may include both its military and other paramilitary forces ", "There are various forms of irregular military forces not belonging to a recognized state though they share many attributes with regular military forces they are less often referred to as simply military ", "A nation s military may function as a discrete social subculture with dedicated infrastructure such as military housing schools utilities logistics hospitals legal services food production finance and banking services ", "Beyond warfare the military may be employed in additional sanctioned and non sanctioned functions within the state including internal security threats population control the promotion of a political agenda emergency services and reconstruction protecting corporate economic interests social ceremonies and national honour guards ", " The profession of soldiering as part of a military is older than recorded history itself ", " Some of the most enduring images of classical antiquity portray the power and feats of its military leaders ", "The Battle of Kadesh in BC was one of the defining points of Pharaoh Ramses II s reign and his monuments commemorate it in bas relief ", "A thousand years later the first emperor of unified China Qin Shi Huang was so determined to impress the gods with his military might that he had himself buried with an army of terracotta soldiers ", " The Romans paid considerable attention to military matters leaving to posterity many treatises and writings on the subject as well as many lavishly carved triumphal arches and victory columns ", "The first recorded use of the word military in English spelled militarie was in ", " It comes from the Latin militaris from Latin miles meaning soldier through French but is of uncertain etymology one suggestion being derived from mil it going in a body or mass ", " As a noun the military usually refers generally to a country s armed forces or sometimes more specifically to the senior officers who command them ", " In general it refers to the physicality of armed forces their personnel equipment and the physical area which they occupy ", "As an adjective military originally referred only to soldiers and soldiering but it soon broadened to apply to land forces in general and anything to do with their profession ", " The names of both the Royal Military Academy and United States Military Academy reflect this ", "However at about the time of the Napoleonic Wars military began to be used in reference to armed forces as a whole such as military service military intelligence and military history ", "As such it now connotes any activity performed by armed force personnel ", " Military history is often considered to be the history of all conflicts not just the history of the state militaries ", "It differs somewhat from the history of war with military history focusing on the people and institutions of war making while the history of war focuses on the evolution of war itself in the face of changing technology governments and geography ", "Military history has a number of facets ", "One main facet is to learn from past accomplishments and mistakes so as to more effectively wage war in the future ", "Another is to create a sense of military tradition which is used to create cohesive military forces ", "Still another may be to learn to prevent wars more effectively ", "Human knowledge about the military is largely based on both recorded and oral history of military conflicts war their participating armies and navies and more recently air forces ", " Despite the growing importance of military technology military activity depends above all on people ", "For example in the British Army declared Man is still the first weapon of war ", " The military organization is characterized by a strict command hierarchy divided by military rank with ranks normally grouped in descending order of authority as officers e g ", "colonel non commissioned officers e g ", "sergeant and personnel at the lowest rank e g ", "private ", "While senior officers make strategic decisions subordinated military personnel soldiers sailors marines or airmen fulfil them ", "Although rank titles vary by military branch and country the rank hierarchy is common to all state armed forces worldwide ", "In addition to their rank personnel occupy one of many trade roles which are often grouped according to the nature of the role s military tasks on combat operations combat roles e g ", "infantry combat support roles e g ", "combat engineers and combat service support roles e g ", "logistical support ", "In the past the armed forces of some Communist states such as the Soviet Union China and Albania have attempted to abolish military ranks but they were later reintroduced due to operational difficulties relating to command and control ", "Personnel may be recruited or conscripted depending on the system chosen by the state ", "Most military personnel are males the minority proportion of female personnel varies internationally approximately in India in the UK in Sweden in the US and in South Africa ", "While two thirds of states now recruit or conscript only adults as of states still relied partly on children under the age of usually aged or to staff their armed forces ", " Whereas recruits who join as officers tend to be upwardly mobile most enlisted personnel have a childhood background of relative socio economic deprivation ", " For example after the US suspended conscription in the military disproportionately attracted African American men men from lower status socioeconomic backgrounds men who had been in nonacademic high school programs and men whose high school grades tended to be low ", " However a study released in on the socio economic backgrounds of U S Armed Forces personnel suggests that they are at parity or slightly higher than the civilian population with respect to socio economic indicators such as parental income parental wealth and cognitive abilities ", "The study found that technological tactical operational and doctrinal changes have led to a change in the demand for personnel ", "Furthermore the study suggests that the most disadvantaged socio economic groups are less likely to meet the requirements of the modern U S ", "military ", " The obligations of military employment are many ", "Full time military employment normally requires a minimum period of service of several years between two and six years is typical of armed forces in Australia the UK and the US for example depending on role branch and rank ", " Some armed forces allow a short discharge window normally during training when recruits may leave the armed force as of right ", " Alternatively part time military employment known as reserve service allows a recruit to maintain a civilian job while training under military discipline at weekends he or she may be called out to deploy on operations to supplement the full time personnel complement ", "After leaving the armed forces recruits may remain liable for compulsory return to full time military employment in order to train or deploy on operations ", " Military law introduces offences not recognised by civilian courts such as absence without leave AWOL desertion political acts malingering behaving disrespectfully and disobedience see for example offences against military law in the United Kingdom ", " Penalties range from a summary reprimand to imprisonment for several years following a court martial ", " Certain fundamental rights are also restricted or suspended including the freedom of association e g ", "union organizing and freedom of speech speaking to the media ", " Military personnel in some countries have a right of conscientious objection if they believe an order is immoral or unlawful or cannot in good conscience carry it out ", "Personnel may be posted to bases in their home country or overseas according to operational need and may be deployed from those bases on exercises or operations anywhere in the world ", "During peacetime when military personnel are generally stationed in garrisons or other permanent military facilities they mostly conduct administrative tasks training and education activities technology maintenance and recruitment ", "Initial training conditions recruits for the demands of military life including preparedness to injure and kill other people and to face mortal danger without fleeing ", "It is a physically and psychologically intensive process which resocializes recruits for the unique nature of military demands ", "For example The next requirement comes as a fairly basic need for the military to identify possible threats it may be called upon to face ", "For this purpose some of the commanding forces and other military as well as often civilian personnel participate in identification of these threats ", "This is at once an organization a system and a process collectively called military intelligence MI ", "The difficulty in using military intelligence concepts and military intelligence methods is in the nature of the secrecy of the information they seek and the clandestine nature that intelligence operatives work in obtaining what may be plans for a conflict escalation initiation of combat or an invasion ", "An important part of the military intelligence role is the military analysis performed to assess military capability of potential future aggressors and provide combat modelling that helps to understand factors on which comparison of forces can be made ", "This helps to quantify and qualify such statements as China and India maintain the largest armed forces in the World or that the U S Military is considered to be the world s strongest ", " Although some groups engaged in combat such as militants or resistance movements refer to themselves using military terminology notably Army or Front none have had the structure of a national military to justify the reference and usually have had to rely on support of outside national militaries ", "They also use these terms to conceal from the MI their true capabilities and to impress potential ideological recruits ", "Having military intelligence representatives participate in the execution of the national defence policy is important because it becomes the first respondent and commentator on the policy expected strategic goal compared to the realities of identified threats ", "When the intelligence reporting is compared to the policy it becomes possible for the national leadership to consider allocating resources over and above the officers and their subordinates military pay and the expense of maintaining military facilities and military support services for them ", "Source SIPRI Defense economics is the financial and monetary efforts made to resource and sustain militaries and to finance military operations including war ", "The process of allocating resources is conducted by determining a military budget which is administered by a military finance organization within

population ", "A pie chart showing global military expenditures by country for in US billions according to SIPRIMap of military expenditures as a percentage of GDP by country ", " needs update Military expenditure of in USDCapability development which is often referred to as the military strength is arguably one of the most complex activities known to humanity because it requires

identifying concepts methods and systems involved in executing the doctrines creating design specifications for the manufacturers who would produce these in adequate quantity and quality for their use in combat purchase the concepts methods and systems create a forces structure that would use the concepts methods and systems most effectively and efficiently integrate these concepts methods and systems into the force structure by providing military education training and practice that preferably resembles combat environment of intended use create military logistics systems to allow continued and uninterrupted performance of military organizations under combat conditions including provision of health services to the personnel and maintenance for the equipment the services to assist recovery of wounded personnel and repair of damaged equipment and finally post conflict demobilization and disposal of war stocks surplus to peacetime requirements ", "Development of military doctrine is perhaps the most important of all capability development activities because it determines how military forces are used in conflicts the concepts and methods used by the command to employ appropriately military skilled armed and equipped personnel in achievement of the tangible goals and objectives of the war campaign battle engagement and action ", " The line between strategy and tactics is not easily blurred although deciding which is being discussed had sometimes been a matter of personal judgement by some commentators and military historians ", "The use of forces at the level of organization between strategic and tactical is called operational mobility ", "Because most of the concepts and methods used by the military and many of its systems are not found in commercial branches much of the material is researched designed developed and offered for inclusion in arsenals by military science organizations within the overall structure of the military ", "Military scientists are therefore found by whom ", "to interact with all Arms and Services of the armed forces and at all levels of the military hierarchy of command ", "Although concerned with research into military psychology particularly combat stress and how it affect troop morale often the bulk of military science activities is directed at military intelligence technology military communications and improving military capability through research ", "The design development and prototyping of weapons military support equipment and military technology in general is also an area in which much effort is invested it includes everything from global communication networks and aircraft carriers to paint and food ", "Possessing military capability is not sufficient if this capability cannot be deployed for and employed in combat operations ", "To achieve this military logistics are used for the logistics management and logistics planning of the forces military supply chain management the consumables and capital equipment of the troops ", "Although mostly concerned with the military transport as a means of delivery using different modes of transport from military trucks to container ships operating from permanent military base it also involves creating field supply dumps at the rear of the combat zone and even forward supply points in a specific unit s tactical area of responsibility ", "These supply points are also used to provide military engineering services such as the recovery of defective and derelict vehicles and weapons maintenance of weapons in the field the repair and field modification of weapons and equipment and in peacetime the life extension programmes undertaken to allow continued use of equipment ", "One of the most important role of logistics is the supply of munitions as a primary type of consumable their storage and disposal ", "The primary reason for the existence of the military is to engage in combat should it be required to do so by the national defence policy and to win ", "This represents an organisational goal of any military and the primary focus for military thought through military history ", "How victory is achieved and what shape it assumes is studied by most if not all military groups on three levels ", "Military strategy is the management of forces in wars and military campaigns by a commander in chief employing large military forces either national and allied as a whole or the component elements of armies navies and air forces such as army groups naval fleets and large numbers of aircraft ", "Military strategy is a long term projection of belligerents policy with a broad view of outcome implications including outside the concerns of military command ", "Military strategy is more concerned with the supply of war and planning than management of field forces and combat between them ", "The scope of strategic military planning can span weeks but is more often months or even years ", " Operational mobility is within warfare and military doctrine the level of command which coordinates the minute details of tactics with the overarching goals of strategy ", "A common synonym is operational art ", "The operational level is at a scale bigger than one where line of sight and the time of day are important and smaller than the strategic level where production and politics are considerations ", "Formations are of the operational level if they are able to conduct operations on their own and are of sufficient size to be directly handled or have a significant impact at the strategic level ", "This concept was pioneered by the German army prior to and during the Second World War ", "At this level planning and duration of activities takes from one week to a month and are executed by Field Armies and Army Corps and their naval and air equivalents ", " Military tactics concerns itself with the methods for engaging and defeating the enemy in direct combat ", "Military tactics are usually used by units over hours or days and are focused on the specific tasks and objectives of squadrons companies battalions regiments brigades and divisions and their naval and air force equivalents ", " One of the oldest military publications is The Art of War by the Chinese philosopher Sun Tzu ", " Written in the th century BCE the chapter book is intended as military instruction and not as military theory but has had a huge influence on Asian military doctrine and from the late th century on European and United States military planning ", "It has even been used to formulate business tactics and can even be applied in social and political areas where ", "The Classical Greeks and the Romans wrote prolifically on military campaigning ", "Among the best known Roman works are Julius Caesar s commentaries on the Gallic Wars and the Roman Civil war written about BC ", "Two major works on tactics come from the late Roman period Taktike Theoria by Aelianus Tacticus and De Re Militari On military matters by Vegetius ", "Taktike Theoria examined Greek military tactics and was most influential in the Byzantine world and during the Golden Age of Islam ", "De Re Militari formed the basis of European military tactics until the late th century ", "Perhaps its most enduring maxim is Igitur qui desiderat pacem praeparet bellum let he who desires peace prepare for war ", "Due to the changing nature of combat with the introduction of artillery in the European Middle Ages and infantry firearms in the Renaissance attempts were made to define and identify those strategies grand tactics and tactics that would produce a victory more often than that achieved by the Romans in praying to the gods before the battle ", "Later this became known as military science and later still would adopt the scientific method approach to the conduct of military operations under the influence of the Industrial Revolution thinking ", "In his seminal book On War the Prussian Major General and leading expert on modern military strategy Carl von Clausewitz defined military strategy as the employment of battles to gain the end of war ", " According to Clausewitz strategy forms the plan of the War and to this end it links together the series of acts which are to lead to the final decision that is to say it makes the plans for the separate campaigns and regulates the combats to be fought in each ", " Hence Clausewitz placed political aims above military goals ensuring civilian control of the military ", "Military strategy was one of a triumvirate of arts or sciences that governed the conduct of warfare the others being military tactics the execution of plans and manoeuvring of forces in battle and maintenance of an army ", "The meaning of military tactics has changed over time from the deployment and manoeuvring of entire land armies on the fields of ancient battles and galley fleets to modern use of small unit ambushes encirclements bombardment attacks frontal assaults air assaults hit and run tactics used mainly by guerrilla forces and in some cases suicide attacks on land and at sea ", "Evolution of aerial warfare introduced its own air combat tactics ", "Often military deception in the form of military camouflage or misdirection using decoys is used to confuse the enemy as a tactic ", "A major development in infantry tactics came with the increased use of trench warfare in the th and th centuries ", "This was mainly employed in World War I in the Gallipoli campaign and the Western Front ", "Trench warfare often turned to a stalemate only broken by a large loss of life because in order to attack an enemy entrenchment soldiers had to run through an exposed no man s land under heavy fire from their opposing entrenched enemy ", "As with any occupation since ancient times the military has been distinguished from other members of the society by their tools the weapons and military equipment used in combat ", "When Stone Age humans first took flint to tip the spear it was the first example of applying technology to improve the weapon ", "Since then the advances made by human societies and that of weapons has been closely linked ", "Stone weapons gave way to Bronze Age and Iron Age weapons such as swords and shields ", "With each technological change was realized some tangible increase in military capability such as through greater effectiveness of a sharper edge in defeating armour or improved density of materials used in manufacture of weapons On land the first significant technological advance in warfare was the development of ranged weapons notably the sling and later the bow and arrow ", "The next significant advance came with the domestication of the horses and mastering of equestrianism creating cavalry and allowing for faster military advances and better logistics ", "Possibly the most significant advancement was the wheel a staple of transportation starting with the chariot and eventually siege engines ", "The bow was manufactured in increasingly larger and more powerful versions to increase both the weapon range and armour penetration performance developing into composite bows recurve bows

applications so too did military and warfare become industrialized ", "The newly invented machine gun and repeating rifle redefined firepower on the battlefield and in part explains the high casualty rates of the American Civil War and the decline of melee combat in warfare ", "The next breakthrough was the conversion of artillery parks from the muzzle loading guns to quicker breech loading guns with recoiling barrels that allowed quicker aimed fire and use of a shield ", "The widespread introduction of low smoke smokeless propellant powders since the s also allowed for a great improvement of artillery ranges ", "The development of breech loading had the greatest effect on naval warfare for the first time since the Middle Ages altering the way weapons are mounted on warships ", "Naval tactics were divorced from the reliance on sails with the invention of the internal combustion ", "A further advance in military naval technology was the submarine and the torpedo During World War I the need to break the deadlock of trench warfare saw the rapid development of many new technologies particularly tanks ", "Military aviation was extensively used and bombers became decisive in many battles of World War II which marked the most frantic period of weapons development in history ", "Many new designs and concepts were used in combat and all existing technologies of warfare were improved between and ", "During World War II significant advances were made in military communications through increased use of radio military intelligence through use of the radar and in military medicine through use of penicillin while in the air the guided missile jet aircraft and helicopters were seen for the first time ", "Perhaps the most infamous of all military technologies was the creation of nuclear weapons although the exact effects of its radiation were unknown until the early s ", "Far greater use of military vehicles had finally eliminated the cavalry from the military force structure ", "After World War II with the onset of the Cold War the constant technological development of new weapons was institutionalized as participants engaged in a constant arms race in capability development ", "This constant state of weapons development continues into the present ", "Main battle tanks and other heavy equipment such as armoured fighting vehicles military aircraft and ships are characteristic to organized military forces ", "The most significant technological developments that influenced combat have been guided missiles which can be used by all branches of the armed services ", "More recently information technology and its use in surveillance including space based reconnaissance systems have played an increasing role in military operations ", "The impact of information warfare which focuses on attacking command communication systems and military databases has been coupled with the use of robotic systems in combat such as unmanned combat aerial vehicles and unmanned ground vehicles ", "Recently there has also been a particular focus towards the use of renewable fuels for running military vehicles on ", "Unlike fossil fuels renewable fuels can be produced in any country creating a strategic advantage ", "The U S military has committed itself to have of its energy consumption come from alternative sources ", " For much of military history the armed forces were considered to be for use by the heads of their societies until recently the crowned heads of states ", "In a democracy or other political system run in the public interest it is a public force ", "The relationship between the military and the society it serves is a complicated and ever evolving one ", "Much depends on the nature of the society itself and whether it sees the military as important as for example in time of threat or war or a burdensome expense typified by defence cuts in time of peace ", "One difficult matter in the relation between military and society is control and transparency ", "In some countries limited information on military operations and budgeting is accessible for the public ", "However transparency in the military sector is crucial to fight corruption ", "This showed the Government Defence Anti corruption Index Transparency International UK published in ", " Militaries often function as societies within societies by having their own

social attitude of being best served or being a beneficiary of a government or guided by concepts embodied in the military culture doctrine system or leaders ", "Either because of the cultural memory

regulate conduct in war and during peacetime ", "An early exponent was Hugo Grotius whose On the Law of War and Peace had a major impact of the humanitarian approach to warfare development ", "His theme was echoed by Gustavus Adolphus ", "Ethics of warfare have developed since to create constraints on the military treatment of prisoners and civilians primarily by the Geneva Conventions but

protocols restrict the use or have even created international bans on some types of weapons notably weapons of mass destruction WMD ", "International conventions define what constitutes a war crime and provides for war crimes prosecution ", "Individual countries also have elaborate codes of military justice an example being the United States Uniform Code of Military Justice that can lead to

impose a temporary or permanent injunction to prevent an act or compel an act ", "A declaratory judgment may be issued to prevent future legal disputes ", "A lawsuit may involve resolution of disputes involving issues of private law between individuals business entities or non profit organizations ", "A lawsuit may also involve issues of public law in the sense that the state is treated as if it were a private party in a civil case either as a plaintiff with a civil cause of action to enforce certain laws or as a defendant in actions contesting the legality of the state s laws or seeking monetary damages for injuries caused by agents of the state ", "Conducting a civil action is called litigation ", "The plaintiffs and defendants are called litigants and the attorneys representing them are called litigators ", " The term litigation may also refer to the conducting of criminal actions see criminal procedure ", "The word lawsuit derives from the combination of law and suit ", "Suit derives from the old French suite sieute meaning to pursue or follow ", "This was in term derived from the Latin secutus the past participle of sequi meaning to attend or follow ", " Similarly the word sue derives from the old French suir sivre meaning to pursue or follow after ", "This was also derived from the Latin word sequi ", " Rules of criminal or civil procedure govern the conduct of a lawsuit in the common law adversarial system of dispute resolution ", "Procedural rules arise from statutory law case law and constitutional provisions especially the right to due process ", "The details of each kind of legal procedure differ greatly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and often from court to court even within the same jurisdiction ", "It is important for litigants to be aware of all relevant procedural rules or to hire competent counsel who can either comply with such rules on their behalf or explain the rules to them because the litigants ultimately dictate the timing and progression of the lawsuit ", "Litigants are responsible for obtaining the desired result and the timing of reaching this result ", "Failure to comply with procedural rules may result in serious limitations that can affect the ability of one to present claims or defenses at any subsequent trial or even lead to the dismissal of the lawsuit altogether ", "Though the majority of lawsuits are settled before ever reaching trial they can still be very complicated to litigate ", "This is particularly true in federal systems where a federal court may be applying state law e g ", "the Erie doctrine for example in the United States o r vice versa ", "It is also possible for one state to apply the law of another in cases where additionally it may not be clear which level or location of court actually has jurisdiction over the claim or personal jurisdiction over the defendant or whether the plaintiff has standing to participate in a lawsuit ", "About percent of civil cases in the United States federal courts are resolved without a trial ", "Domestic courts are also often called upon to apply foreign law or to act upon foreign defendants over whom they may not even have the ability to even enforce a judgment if the defendant s assets are theoretically outside their reach ", "Lawsuits can become additionally complicated as more parties become involved see joinder ", "Within a single lawsuit there can be any number of claims and defenses all based on numerous laws between any number of plaintiffs or defendants ", "Each of these participants can bring any number of cross claims and counterclaims against each other and even bring additional parties into the suit on either side after it progresses ", "In reality however courts typically have some power to sever claims and parties into separate actions if it is more efficient to do so ", "A court can do this if there is not a sufficient overlap of factual issues between the various associates separating the issues into different lawsuits ", "The official ruling of a lawsuit can be somewhat misleading because post ruling outcomes are often not listed on the internet ", "For example in the case of William J Ralph Jr v Lind Waldock Company September one would assume that Mr Ralph lost the case when in fact upon review of the evidence it was found that Mr Ralph was correct in his assertion that improper activity took place on the part of Lind Waldock and Mr Ralph settled with Lind Waldock ", " Cases such as this illustrate the need for more comprehensive information than mere internet searches when researching legal decisions ", "While online searches are appropriate for many legal situations they are not appropriate for all ", "The following is a generalized description of how a lawsuit may proceed in a common law jurisdiction A lawsuit begins when a complaint or petition known as a pleading is filed with the court ", "A complaint should explicitly state that one or more plaintiffs seek s damages or equitable relief from one or more stated defendants and also should state the relevant factual allegations supporting the legal claims brought by the plaintiffs ", "As the initial pleading a complaint is the most important step in a civil case because a complaint sets the factual and legal foundation for the entirety of a case ", "While complaints and other pleadings may ordinarily be amended by a motion with the court the complaint sets the framework for the entire case and the claims that will be asserted throughout the entire lawsuit ", "It is likewise important that the plaintiff select the proper venue with the proper jurisdiction to bring the lawsuit ", "The clerk of a court signs or stamps the court seal upon a summons or citation which is then served by the plaintiff upon the defendant together with a copy of the complaint ", "This service notifies the defendants that they are being sued and that they are limited in the amount of time of a reply ", "The service provides a copy of the complaint in order to notify the defendants of the nature of the claims ", "Once the defendants are served with the summons and complaint they are subject to a time limit to file an answer stating their defenses to the plaintiff s claims which includes any challenges to the court s jurisdiction and any counterclaims they wish to assert against the plaintiff ", "In a handful of jurisdictions notably the U S state of New York a lawsuit begins when one or more plaintiffs properly serve a summons and complaint upon the defendants ", "In such jurisdictions nothing must be filed with the court until a dispute develops requiring actual judicial intervention ", "If the defendant chooses to file an answer within the time permitted the answer must address each of the plaintiffs allegations ", "The defendant has three choices to make which include either admitting to the allegation denying it or pleading a lack of sufficient information to admit or deny the allegation ", "Some jurisdictions like California and Florida still authorize general denials of each and every allegation in the complaint ", "At the time the defendant files an answer the defendant also raises all affirmative defenses ", "The defendant may also assert counterclaims for damages or equitable relief against the plaintiff ", "For example in the case of compulsory counterclaims the defendant must assert some form of counterclaim or risk having the counterclaim barred in any subsequent proceeding ", "In the case of making a counterclaim the defendant is making a motion directed towards the plaintiff claiming that he she was injured in some way or would like to sue the plaintiff ", "The plaintiff in this example would then receive some amount of time to make a reply to this counterclaim ", "The defendant may also file a third party complaint which is the defendant s privilege to join another party or parties in the action with the belief that those parties may be liable for some or all of the plaintiff s claimed damages ", "An answer from the defendant in response to the claims made against him her can also include additional facts or a so called excuse for the plead ", "Filing an answer joins the cause and moves the case into the pre trial phase ", "Instead of filing an answer within the time specified in the summons the defendant can choose to dispute the validity of the complaint by filing a demurrer in the handful of jurisdictions where that is still allowed or one or more pre answer motions such as a motion to dismiss ", "It is important that the motion be filed within the time period specified in the summons for an answer ", "If all of the above motions are denied by the trial court and the defendant loses on all appeals from such denials if that option is available and finally the defendant must file an answer ", "Usually the pleadings are drafted by a lawyer but in many courts persons can file papers and represent themselves which is called appearing pro se ", "Many courts have a pro se clerk to assist people without lawyers ", "A pretrial discovery can be defined as the formal process of exchanging information between the parties about the witnesses and evidence they ll present at trial and allows for the evidence of the trial to be presented to the parties before the initial trial begins ", " The early stages of the lawsuit may involve initial disclosures of evidence by each party and discovery which is the structured exchange of evidence and statements between the parties ", "Discovery is meant to eliminate surprises clarify what the lawsuit is about and also to make the parties decide if they should settle or drop frivolous claims and or defenses ", "At this point the parties may also engage in pretrial motions to exclude or include particular legal or factual issues before trial ", "There is also the ability of one to make an under oath statement during the pretrial also known as a deposition ", "The deposition can be used in the trial or just in the pretrial but this allows for both parties to be aware of the arguments or claims that are going to be made by the other party in the trial ", "It is notable that the depositions can be written or oral ", " At the close of discovery the parties may either pick a jury and then have a trial by jury or the case may proceed as a bench trial ", "A bench trial is only heard by the judge if the parties waive a jury trial or if the right to a jury trial is not guaranteed for their particular claim such as those under equity in the U S or for any lawsuits within their jurisdiction ", "Usually lawsuits end in a settlement with an empirical analysis finding that less than of cases end with a trial ", " It is sometimes said that of cases end in settlement few jurisdictions report settlements but empirical analysis suggests that the settlement rate varies by type of lawsuit with torts settling around of the time and overall civil cases settling of the time other cases end due to default judgment lack of a valid claim and other reasons ", " At trial each person presents witnesses and the evidence collected is recorded ", "After this occurs the judge or jury renders their decision ", "Generally speaking the plaintiff has the burden of proof in making his claims however the defendant may have the burden of proof on other issues such as affirmative defenses ", "The attorneys are held responsible in devising a trial strategy that ensures they meet the necessary elements of their case or when the opposing party has the burden of proof to ensure the opponent will not be able to meet his or her burden ", "There are numerous motions that either party can file throughout the lawsuit to terminate it prematurely before submission to the judge or jury for final consideration ", "These motions attempt to persuade the judge through legal argument and sometimes accompanying evidence that there is no reasonable way that the other party could legally win and therefore there is no sense in continuing with the trial ", "Motions for summary judgment for example can usually be brought before after or during the actual presentation of the case ", "Motions can also be brought after the close of a trial to undo a jury verdict contrary to law or against the weight of the evidence or to convince the judge to change the decision or grant a new trial ", "Also at any time during this process from the filing of the complaint to the final judgment the plaintiff may withdraw the complaint and end the whole matter or the defendant may agree to a settlement ", "If the case settles the parties might choose to enter into a stipulated judgment with the settlement agreement attached or the plaintiff may simply file a voluntary dismissal so that the settlement agreement is never entered into the court record ", "The decisions that the jury makes are not put into effect until the judge makes a judgment which is the approval to have this trial information be filed in public records ", "In a civil case the judge is allowed at this time to make changes to the verdict that the jury came up with by either adding on or reducing the punishment ", "In criminal cases the situation is a little different because in this case the judge does not have the authority to change the jury decision ", "After a final decision has been made either party or both may appeal from the judgment if they believe there had been a procedural error made by the trial court ", "It isn t necessarily an automatic appeal after every judgment has been made however if there is a legal basis for the appeal then one has the right to do so ", "The prevailing party may appeal for example if they wanted a larger award than was granted ", "The appellate court which may be structured as an intermediate appellate court and or a higher court then affirms the judgment declines to hear it which effectively affirms it reverses or vacates and remands ", "This process would then involve sending the lawsuit back to the lower trial court to address an unresolved issue or possibly request for a whole new trial ", "Some lawsuits go up and down the appeals ladder repeatedly before final resolution ", "The appeal is a review for errors rather than a new trial so the appellate court will defer to the discretion of the original trial court if an error is not clear ", "The initial step in making an appeal consists of the petitioner filing a notice of appeal and then sending in a brief a written document stating reason for appeal to the court ", "Decisions of the court can be made immediately after just reading the written brief or there can also be oral arguments made by both parties involved in the appeal ", "The appellate court then makes the decision about what errors were made when the law was looked at more closely in the lower court ", "There were no errors made the case would then end but if the decision was reversed the appellate court would then send the case back down to the lower court level ", "There a new trial will be held and new information taken into account ", "Some jurisdictions notably the United States but prevalent in many other countries prevent parties from relitigating the facts on appeal due to a history of unscrupulous lawyers deliberately reserving such issues in order to ambush each other in the appellate courts the invited error problem ", "The idea is that it is more efficient to force all parties to fully litigate all relevant issues of fact before the trial court ", "Thus a party who does not raise an issue of fact at the trial court level generally cannot raise it on appeal ", "When the lawsuit is finally resolved or the allotted time to appeal has expired the matter is res judicata meaning the plaintiff may not bring another action based on the same claim again ", "In addition other parties who later attempt to re litigate a matter already ruled on in a previous lawsuit will be estopped from doing so ", "When a final judgment is entered the plaintiff is usually barred under the doctrine of res judicata from relitigating any of the issues even under different legal theories ", "Judgments are typically a monetary award ", "If the defendant fails to pay the court has various powers to seize any of the defendant s assets located within its jurisdiction such as If all assets are located elsewhere the plaintiff must file another suit in the appropriate court to seek enforcement of the other court s previous judgment ", "This can be a difficult task when crossing from a court in one state or nation to another however courts tend to grant each other respect when there is not a clear legal rule to the contrary ", "A defendant who has no assets in any jurisdiction is said to be judgment proof ", " The term is generally a colloquialism to describe an impecunious defendant ", "Indigent judgment proof defendants are no longer imprisoned debtor s prisons have been outlawed by statute constitutional amendment or international human rights treaties in the vast majority of common law jurisdictions ", "Scholars in law economics and management have studied why firms involved in a dispute choose between private dispute resolution such as negotiation mediation and arbitration and litigation ", " During the th and th centuries it was common for lawyers to speak of bringing an action at law and a suit in equity ", "An example of that distinction survives today in the codified text of the Third Enforcement Act ", "The fusion of common law and equity in England in the Judicature Acts of and led to the collapse of that distinction so it became possible to speak of a lawsuit ", "In the United States the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure abolished the distinction between actions at law and suits in equity in federal practice in favor of a single form referred to as a civil action ", "In England and Wales the term claim is far more common the person initiating proceedings is called the claimant ", " American terminology is slightly different in that the term claim refers only to a particular count or cause of action in a lawsuit ", "Americans also use claim to describe an extrajudicial demand filed with an insurer or administrative agency ", " If the claim is denied then the claimant policyholder or applicant files a lawsuit with the courts to seek review of that decision and from that point forward participates in the lawsuit as a plaintiff ", "In other words the terms claimant and plaintiff carry substantially different connotations of formality in American English in that only the latter risks an award of costs in favor of an adversary in a lawsuit ", "In medieval times both action and suit had the approximate meaning of some kind of legal proceeding but an action terminated when a judgment was rendered while a suit also included the execution of the judgment ", "Particularly in the United States plaintiffs and defendants who lack financial resources for litigation or other attorney s fees may be able to obtain legal financing ", "Legal financing companies can provide a cash advance to litigants in return for a share of the ultimate settlement or award ", "If the case ultimately loses the litigant does not have to pay any of the money funded back ", "Legal financing is different from a typical bank loan in that the legal financing company does not look at credit history or employment history ", "Litigants do not have to repay the cash advance with monthly payments but do have to fill out an application so that the legal financing company can review the merits of the case ", "Legal financing can be a practical means for litigants to obtain financing while they wait for a monetary settlement or an award in their personal injury workers compensation or civil rights lawsuit ", "Often plaintiffs who were injured or forced to leave their jobs still have mortgages rent medical expenses or other bills to pay ", "Other times litigants may simply need money to pay for the costs of litigation and attorneys fees and for this reason many litigants turn to reputable legal financing companies to apply for a cash advance to help pay for bills ", "Defendants civil rights organizations public interest organizations and government public officials can all set up an account to pay for litigation costs and legal expenses ", "These legal defense funds can have large membership counts where the members contribute to the fund ", "Unlike legal financing from legal financing companies legal defense funds provide a separate account for litigation rather than a one time cash advancement nevertheless both are used for purposes of financing litigation and legal costs ", "There was a study conducted in the Supreme Court Economic Review that shows why litigation financing can be practical and beneficial to the overall court system and lawsuits within the court ", "This study concluded that the new rules that were set for litigation financing actually did produce more settlements ", "Under conservative rules there tended to be fewer settlements however under the older rules they tended to be larger on average ", " Legal financing can become an issue in some cases varying from case to case and person to person ", "It can be beneficial in many situations however also detrimental in others "]},

adhere to common law tradition ", "The borderline between public law and private law is not always clear ", "Law as a whole cannot neatly be divided into law for the State and law for everyone else ", "As such the distinction between public and private law is largely functional rather than factual classifying laws according to which domain the activities participants and principal concerns involved best fit into ", " This has given rise to attempts to establish a theoretical understanding for the basis of public law ", "The distinction between public and private law was first made by Roman jurist Ulpian who argues in the Institutes in a passage preserved by Justinian in the Digest that p ublic law is that which respects the establishment of the Roman commonwealth private that which respects individuals interests some matters being of public and others of private interest ", "Furthermore he defines public law as the law concerning religious affairs the priesthood and offices of the State ", " Roman Law conceived of the law as a series of relationships between persons and persons persons and things and persons and the State ", "Public law consisted of the latter of these three relationships ", " However Roman lawyers devoted little attention to this area and instead focussed largely on areas of private law ", "It was however of great importance in Teutonic society as noted by German legal historian Otto von Gierke who defined the Teutons as the fathers of public law ", " Drawing a line between public and private law largely fell out of favor in the ensuing millennium though as Ernst Kantorowicz notes Medieval saw a concern with the Roman conception of the res publica inherent in the legal fiction of the king s two bodies ", " However legal philosophers during this period consisted largely of theologians who operated within the realm of Canon Law and were instead concerned with distinctions between divine law natural law and human law ", " The public private divide in law would not return until the th and th centuries ", "Through the emergence of the nation state and new theories of sovereignty notions of a distinctly public realm began to crystalize ", "However the claims made by monarchs and later parliaments to an unrestrained power to make law spurred attempts to establish a distinctly private sphere that would be free from encroaching State power in return ", " Traditionally the division between public and private law has been made in the context of the legal systems found in Continental Europe whose laws all fall within the tradition of civil law ", "However the public private divide does not apply strictly to civil law systems ", "Given public law s emphasis on aspects of the State that are true of all systems of government and law common law legal systems acknowledge even if they do so unconsciously that actions which must be prohibited by the State need not necessarily be prohibited for private parties as well ", " As such legal scholars commenting on common law systems such as England and Canada have made this distinction as well ", "For many years public law occupied a marginal position in continental European law ", "By and large private law was considered general law ", "Public law on the other hand was considered to consist of exceptions to this general law ", " It was not until the second half of the twentieth century that public law began to play a prominent role in European society through the constitutionalization of private law as well as the development of administrative law and various functional fields of law including labor law medical law and consumer law ", "Though this began to blur the distinction between public and private law it did not erode the former ", "Instead it elevated public law from its once marginal state with an acknowledgment that there are few if any areas of the law that are free from potential State intervention ", " In Italy for example the development of public law was considered a project of state building following the ideas of Vittorio Emanuele Orlando ", "Indeed many early Italian public lawyers were also politicians including Orlando himself ", " Now in countries such as France public law now refers to the areas of constitutional law administrative law and criminal law ", "In modern states constitutional law lays out the foundations of the state ", "Above all it postulates the supremacy of law in the functioning of the state the rule of law ", "Secondly it sets out the form of government how its different branches work how they are elected or appointed and the division of powers and responsibilities between them ", "Traditionally the basic elements of government are the executive the legislature and the judiciary ", "And thirdly in describing what are the basic human rights which must be protected for every person and what further civil and political rights citizens have it sets the fundamental borders to what any government must and must not do ", "In most jurisdictions constitutional law is enshrined in a written document the Constitution sometimes together with amendments or other constitutional laws ", "In some countries however such a supreme entrenched written document does not exist for historical and political reasons the Constitution of the United Kingdom is an unwritten one ", "Administrative law refers to the body of law that regulates bureaucratic managerial procedures and defines the powers of administrative agencies ", "These laws are enforced by the executive branch of a government rather than the judicial or legislative branches if they are different in that particular jurisdiction ", "This body of law regulates international trade manufacturing pollution taxation and the like ", "This is sometimes seen as a subcategory of civil law and sometimes seen as public law as it deals with regulation and public institutionsTax law first became an area of public law during the th century as a consequence of new theories of sovereignty that began to emerge ", "Until this point taxes were considered gifts under the law given to the State by a private donor the taxpayer ", " It is now considered an area of public law as it concerns a relationship between persons and the State ", "The analytical and historical distinction between public and private law has emerged predominantly in the legal systems of continental Europe ", " As a result German language legal literature has produced extensive discussion on the precise nature of the distinction between public law and private law ", " Several theories have evolved which are neither exhaustive nor mutually exclusive or separate ", "The interest theory of public law emerges from the work of Roman jurist Ulpian who stated Publicum ius est quod ad statum rei Romanae spectat privatum quod ad singulorum utilitatem ", " Public law is that which concerns Roman state private law is concerned with the interests of citizens ", "Charles Louis Montesquieu elaborates upon this theory in The Spirit of the Laws published during the th century wherein Montesquieu establishes a distinction between international right of nations public political right and private civil right law according to various actors interests and rights ", "There he writes Considered as inhabitants of a planet so large that different peoples are necessary they have laws bearing on the relation that these peoples have with one another and this is the mw parser output span smallcaps font variant small caps mw parser

governed and this is the political right ", "Further they have laws concerning the relation that alI citizens have with one another and this is the civil right ", " Criticisms of interest theory include the difficulty in establishing a clear distinction between private and public interest if such a distinction does exist and categorizing laws accordingly ", "The subjection theory focuses on explaining the distinction by emphasizing the subordination of private persons to the state ", "Public law is supposed to govern this relationship whereas private law is considered to govern relationships where the parties involved meet on a level playing field ", "However some areas commonly considered private law also imply subordination such as employment law ", "Moreover legal proceedings wherein the State is a party may undermine the totality of the State s authority and the degree to which private persons are subordinate to the State if a Court finds in favor of a non State party see Carpenter v United States for example ", "The subject theory is concerned with the position of the subject of law in the legal relationship in question ", "If it finds itself in a particular situation as a public person due to membership in some public body such as a state or a municipality public law applies otherwise it is private law ", "A combination of the subjection theory and the subject theory arguably provides a workable distinction ", "Under this approach a field of law is considered public law where one actor is a public authority endowed with the power to act unilaterally imperium and this actor uses that imperium in the particular relationship ", "In other words all depends whether the public authority is acting as a public or a private entity say when ordering office supplies ", "This latest theory considers public law a special instance ", "There are areas of law that do not seem to fit into either public or private law such as employment law parts of it look like private law the employment contract while other parts look like public law the activities of an employment inspectorate when investigating workplace safety ", "The distinction
